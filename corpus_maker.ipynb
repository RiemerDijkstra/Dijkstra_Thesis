    "I initially used gensim's Wikicorpus to extract a txt file from a Wikipedia drump. Some problems occurred: Wikicorpus removes stop words, punctuation and also some non-alphabetical words (dates etc.). Therefore, it did not seem like the optimal method of preprocessing. The code is stated below. "

The latter, who was waiting for an excuse to annex Mosul, conquered Sinjar in September 1170 and besieged Mosul, which surrendered on 22 January 1171. After ousting al-Masish, he put Gümüshtekin, one of his officers, as governor, leaving Saif ud-Din nothing but the nominal title of emir. The latter also married the daughter of Nur ad-Din. \n",
