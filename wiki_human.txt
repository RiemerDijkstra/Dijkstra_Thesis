'Sayf al-Din Ghazi (II) ibn Mawdud' (; full name: Sayf al-Din Ghazi II ibn Mawdud ibn Zengi; died 1180) was a Zangid Emir of Mosul, the nephew of Nur ad-Din Zengi. 
He became Emir of Mosul in 1170 after the death of his father Qutb ad-Din Mawdud. Saif had been chosen as the successor under the advice of eunuch ’Abd al-Masish, who wanted to keep the effective rule in lieu of the young emir; the disinherited son of Mawdud, Imad ad-Din Zengi II, fled to Aleppo at the court of Nur ad-Din. The latter, who was waiting for an excuse to annex Mosul, conquered Sinjar in September 1170 and besieged Mosul, which surrendered on 22 January 1171. After ousting al-Masish, he put Gümüshtekin, one of his officers, as governor, leaving Saif ud-Din nothing but the nominal title of emir. The latter also married the daughter of Nur ad-Din. 
At Nur ad-Din's death (May 1174), Gümüshtekin went to Damascus to take control of his son and entitled himself of atabeg of Aleppo. Saif ud-Din rejected his tutorage and restored his independence. The nobles of Damascus, worried by Gümüshtekin's increasing power, offered Saif ud-Din their city, but he could not intervene since he was busy in retaking Mosul. Thenceforth Damascus was given to Saladin.
Saladin took control of Biladu-Sham (Syria) but Saif ud-Din wanted to take over Aleppo, so he sent his brother Izz ad-Din Mas'ud at the head of an army to fight Saladin: they met in an area near Hama called Kron Hama (Arabic: قرون حماه) where Saif ud-Din was defeated. Later he prepared for another battle at Tell al-Sultan (Arabic: تل سلطان) near Aleppo, where he was also defeated; he went back to Mosul and sent messengers to Saladin offering his alliance, which was accepted.
Saif ud-Din died from tuberculosis, and his brother Izz ad-Din Mas'ud succeeded him in 1180.

*'Knarsdale', historically Knaresdale, is a village in Northumberland, England about  north of Alston. The village takes its name from the Knarr Burn: Knarr means 'rugged rock'.
 
== History ==
The manor of Knarsdale was held in medieval times by the Swinburn family, and in 1313 Hugh de Swinburn was rector of Knarsdale. It was later held by the Wallis family, who sold it in 1730 to John Stephenson, a Newcastle merchant. One of the Stephenson family built Alston market cross. But in 1769 Knarsdale was sold to James Wallace, a distinguished lawyer. His son Thomas, for services to his country, was created Baron Wallace of Knarsdale. The family also owned Featherstone Castle, and Hodgson described Knarsdale Hall as having declined in importance — 'a gentleman's place of the 17th century now and for a long time since occupied by the farmer of the adjoining grounds... The garden walls have lost their trimness, the malt kilns and the brewhouse are gone'. Today, however, the stone buildings on top of a high mound dominate the scene and are strongly built. The mullioned windows seem to have been inserted into an older hall.
== Governance ==
Knarsdale is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham.
== Religious sites ==
The church is dedicated to St Jude, and Hodgson saw it in a ruinous condition, with stone lying about. It had been rebuilt in the seventeenth century, and old grave slabs were used in the building. In 1833, however, it was rebuilt at a cost of £300 and a new rectory was erected at this time. On the south wall of the church, beneath the sundial, is a stone carved with 'Erected 1833. Rev. Thomas Bewsher, Rector. William Parker and Joseph Richardson, Church Wardens. Enlarged 1882. Vestry and Porch added 1906'. There is a fine collection of gravestones and one carried a strange inscription, which Hodgson called 'disgraceful doggerel':
All you who please these lines to read
It will cause a tender heart to bleed:
I murdered was upon the fell,
And by a man I knew full well;
My bread and butter which he'd lade,
I, being harmless, was betrayed.
I hope he will rewarded be,
That laid the poison here for me.
It was the epitaph of Robert Baxter, who died 4 October 1796. A man with whom he had a quarrel allegedly left a poisoned wrapped sandwich for him, but there was seemingly no inquest to confirm the accusation. The gravestone is now broken.

* GENUKI (Accessed: 27 November 2008)'Netherwitton' is a village in Northumberland, England about  west of Morpeth.
A former cotton-mill now converted into residential housing, the old village school also converted into a house, an old bridge, a small church, and a number of cottages and gardens comprise the village. The old cross, dated 1689, still stands in a garden beyond the green. Most of the common about it has been appropriated and planted with trees.
== History ==
During the Civil War, Cromwell quartered a large force in the grounds of the stately Netherwitton Hall for one night, and later awarded a sum of £95-5s-6d. as compensation for the damage done by his troops. After Culloden in 1746 Lord Lovat, a Jacobite leader, for a long while lay concealed in a "Priest's Hole" in an upper room of the Hall. Roger Thornton, a great merchant-prince of Newcastle at the beginning of the 15th century, was a native of Netherwitton and built a castle by the river, but no trace of it remains.
== Landmarks ==
The 'Devil's Causeway' passes the village less than  to the east. The causeway is a Roman road which starts at Port Gate on Hadrian's Wall, north of Corbridge, and extends  northwards across Northumberland to the mouth of the River Tweed at Berwick-upon-Tweed.
'Devils Causeway Tower', Netherwitton, also known as, or recorded in historical documents as Highbush Wood. King writes ‘Marked on some OS maps as tower but now considered to be remains of cottage.’ SMR still records as ‘site of tower’. Long records as ‘remains of an irregular shaped tower.’ This site has been described as a Pele Tower. The confidence that this site is a medieval fortification or palace is Questionable.
'Netherwitton Hall' is a Grade I listed building. There has been a house on the site since the 14th century. The present house, which was built in about 1685, to a design by architect Robert Trollope has an impressive three-storey, seven-bayed frontage with balustrade and unusual irregular window pediments. The rear presents some earlier features including a stairway tower which may contain remnants of ancient fortifications. The gardens contain a folly and masonry features.
== Religious sites ==
The church is dedicated to St Giles. He is the saint referred to as "Saint Aegidius" in one of the stained glass windows in the church, 'Aegidius' being the Latin form of the name 'Giles'.

==Location==
Beit Ijza is located    north-west of Jerusalem,  bordered by Al Jib to the east and Al Jib lands to the north, Beit Duqqu to the west, and Biddu to the south.
==History==
=== Ottoman era ===
Beit Ijza  was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers as being in the 'nahiya' of Al-Quds in the 'liwa' of Al-Quds under the name of 'Bayt Iza'. It had a population of 6 household; who were all Muslims. They paid a fixed Ziamet tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 2,500 akçe.
In 1738 Richard Pococke named it 'Beteser', seeing it "on the hill to the east of the valley".
In 1838, it was described as a Muslim  village, located in the 'Beni Malik' area, west of Jerusalem.
In 1883 the PEF's 'Survey of Western Palestine' (SWP) described 'Beit Izza' as: "a village of moderate size on a hill with a spring at some distance to the west."
===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, "Bait Izza" had a population of 59 Muslims, decreasing slightly in the 1931 census to 54 Muslims, in 14 houses.
In the 1945 statistics Beit Ijza had a population of  70 Muslims, with a total of 2,550 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, Arabs used 122 dunams for plantations and irrigable land, 922 for cereals, while 8 dunams were built-up (urban) land.
===Jordanian era===
In the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Beit Ijza came  under Jordanian rule.
The Jordanian census of 1961 found 129 inhabitants in Beit Ijza.
===Post 1967===
Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Beit Ijza has been under Israeli occupation.
Under the 1995 Oslo II Accord, 6.7% of the total village area was classified as Area B, and the remaining 93.3% classified as Area C, under full Israeli control. Israel has confiscated land in Beit Ijza for settlements, including Giv'at Ze'ev and Giv'on Ha'hadasha. In addition, the separation wall extends onto Beit Ijza land, leaving 980 dunums, (or 38.1% of the total village's area), behind the wall, on the Israeli side. The Palestinian owners of the land must rely on Israeli permission to access their land. Permission is only granted to the property owner, often elderly people, leaving them unable to hire help to work the land. One family in Beit Ijza lives with walls on all sides of its property due to extensive land expropriations by Israel.
==Shrine==
Tawfiq Canaan found a Maqam (shrine) for 'en-nabi' Yusif, on a spot which dominated Beit Ijza.

'Duvauchelle Bay' () is a small town situated at the head of Akaroa Harbour on Banks Peninsula in New Zealand. State Highway 75 passes through the town. The Onawe Peninsula separates Duvauchelle bay from Barry's Bay.
Duvauchelle is now part of Christchurch City Council jurisdiction since the city's amalgamation with Banks Peninsula District in 2006. From 1910 until 1989, Duvauchelle was the seat of the Akaroa County Council.
Duvauchelle is grouped with other settlements including French Farm, Wainui, Robinson's Bay and Takamatua as the statistical area of Akaroa Harbour. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, Akaroa Harbour has a population of 777, an increase of 42 people since the 2006 census. There were 387 males and 390 females.
==History==
The site of an ancient Māori pā or fortified settlement is at Oinako, where the Duvauchelle Hotel stands today. At Te Wharau creek, a taua or war party of Ngāti Awa warriors camped during the battles led by Te Rauparaha in 1831.
The name of the town and bay comes from the surname of two brothers Jules-Augustin and Louis-Benjamin Duvauchelle, who held land there from the Nanto-Bordelaise Company, at the time of the French settlement at Akaroa in the 1840s. In the following decade, land alongside Duvauchelle Bay was leased from the Canterbury Association by British settlers, including William Augustus Gordon, who was the brother of Charles George Gordon, the famous soldier and colonial administrator, known as "Gordon of Khartoum" after his death. The first freeholds were bought in 1857; economic activity was focussed on timber extraction and sawing, mostly totara trees. Domestic pigs were grazed in the forest, who mingled with the feral pigs that were already present. As the tree cover was cleared, it was replaced with pasture. The first settler at the Head of the Bay, the location of the present town, was a Frenchman called Libeau, who arrived in 1841. Timber exploitation was also the main activity, as well as boat building. The sawn timber was all carried out of the bay by locally built vessels. A public house and a shop were built in the 1850s. A small building that served as both church and school was built by local people on a half-acre plot of land donated by Lord Lyttelton. The first permanent roads began to be constructed in the 1860s and 1879 saw the arrival of the County Council offices and the Post Office.
Both the Duvauchelle Hotel and the post office were badly damaged by the earthquakes that struck the region in 2010 and 2011. The oldest parts of the hotel were demolished after the earthquakes, the remaining parts of the building were reopened as a single-storey establishment in September 2013. The Post Office was demolished in late 2012.

The 'Fortescue River' is an ephemeral river in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is the third longest river in the state.
==Course==
The river rises near Deadman Hill in the Ophthalmia Range about 30 km south of Newman. The river flows in a northerly direction parallel with the Great Northern Highway until it crosses the highway just south of the Marble Bar turn-off. The river then runs north-west then west crossing the Great Northern Highway again, north of the Auski Roadhouse. Approximately  north of Newman, the river flows through the  Fortescue Marsh, an important wetland. The river continues to head west crossing Highway 1 at the Fortescue Roadhouse () and discharges into the Indian Ocean at Mardie Station about 40 km south-west of Dampier
== Tributaries ==
The river is known to have 24 tributaries that include: Western Creek, Warrawanda Creek, Shovelanna Creek, Kalgan Creek, Fortescue River South, Cowcumba Creek, Macklin Creek and Tanga Tanga Creek.
During Cyclone Joan in 1975 many of these tributaries also flooded. Weeli Wolli Creek and Weelumurra Creek both overflowed and caused floods and washaways on the Hamersley Iron and Mount Newman railway lines.
The river flows through a number of permanent water pools on the latter part of its journey including Tarda Pool, Mungowarra Pool, Crossing Pool and Deep Reach Pool.
== Catchment ==
The Fortescue Catchment area drains from the southern side of the Chichester Plateau and the northern side of the Hamersley Range making use of the trough between the two. The valley plains are composed of earthy clays with some cracking clays, loams and hard red soils.
Water is stored at Ophthalmia Dam which holds a total volume of 32,000ML, and a total of 6,290 ML/year are drawn from the surface water for use in the town of Newman.
===Fortescue Marshes===
::'See also Fortescue Marshes'
The headwaters area of Fortescue River is flat and marshy.  It is a location where Western Creek, Warrawanda Creek and Fortescue River converge.
The river then flows through a poorly defined channel as far as Gregory Gorge, when the river starts to form a well defined channel. It then flows through a number of pools before reaching the estuarine area.
== Estuary ==
The mouth of the river is a large estuarine area.  The estuary is mostly unmodified, and functions primarily as a result of river energy.  The delta formed by the river is tide dominated.
The estuary covers a total surface area of 
The majority of the estuarine area is made up of salt marsh and intertidal flats. A colony of mangroves use the estuary as habitat and occupy an area of . Large female Barramundi are known to inhabit the estuary.
==History==
The river was named in 1861 during an expedition by the explorer and surveyor Francis Thomas Gregory, after Chichester Fortescue, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.
The traditional owners of the area that the river flows through are the Indjibandi peoples.
Mardie Station, at the western end of the river, was established prior to 1883. Three paddocks were fenced, and by that year were carrying about 18,000 sheep.
Roy Hill Station, much further inland, was settled in 1886 by Nat Cooke who owned Mallina Station. The first official lease was granted to D. MacKay in 1890 for an area of .
A  bridge crossing the river near Roy Hill was constructed in the late 1920s to service the cattle industry.
==Damming proposals==
The river has been surveyed and proposed as a site for dams, in the Gregory Gorge and the Dogger Gorge as well as Ophthalmia.

== References ==The Cercle Cité on the Place d'Armes in the centre of Luxembourg City
The 'Cercle Municipal' or 'Cercle Cité' is a building in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg, It is located at the eastern end of the Place d'Armes, in the historic central Ville Haute quarter of the city.
==History==
On a site where there had previously been a building intended as a 'Cercle littéraire' but which finally housed a restaurant by the name of 'Beim Gréitchen', the city decided to construct a grand administrative building. The design competition launched in 1902 was won in 1904 by Pierre and Paul Funck, a father and son team. The administration started to move into the neo-baroque building in 1909 but the official inauguration was in 1910. On the front, above the balcony, is a frieze depicting the granting of the city charter to Luxembourg City in 1244.
The building hosted the Court of Justice of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was established in Luxembourg in 1952, until 1969. It was used as the venue of public hearings of the court until a more permanent venue could be found, whilst other work was conducted at the Villa Vauban, in the Municipal Park.
Through 2020 and 2021, due to restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cercle Municipal became the meeting place of the Chamber of Deputies.
==Renovation and reopening==
The Foyer after renovation (June 2011)In 2006, comprehensive renovation and restoration work was carried out on the Cercle in order to transform it into a convention and exhibition centre. The work was completed in April 2011 providing not only enhancements to the Grande Salle and the Foyer but also to the cellar, which can now house exhibitions, and the former loft, now the fifth floor, where four rooms form a new conference centre. It took on the name Cercle-Cité after an adjacent building on the site of the former Ciné Cité was connected to the Cercle by means of a bridge over the Rue Genistre in order to expand the Cercle's facilities.
==References=='Troy Tate' is an English musician and record producer who was a member of several bands including The Teardrop Explodes and Fashion as well as working as a solo artist, for which he is best known for the single "Love Is ..."
==Biography==
Born in Liverpool, England, Tate's first band was the Cheltenham-based punk rock band Index, who released one single, "Jet Lag" c/w "Total Bland" in 1978. He moved on to join former members of The Rezillos in the band Shake, recording two singles with this band. In 1981, he first recorded as a solo artist, releasing the "Thomas" single on the RCA label Why-Fi. He joined The Teardrop Explodes in late 1980, replacing Alan Gill on guitar, and playing on the 'Wilder' album. While with the band, he continued his solo career, releasing "Lifeline" in 1982. He left The Teardrop Explodes, and joined Fashion in October 1982, leaving in 1983 when he signed to Rough Trade Records, for whom he debuted that year with "Love Is ...".
Tate moved on to Sire Records in 1984, who issued a remixed version of "Thomas", which was followed by his debut solo album, 'Ticket to the Dark' the same year. The album featured contributions from former-Rezillos and Shake drummer Ali Paterson, former-Teardrop Explodes member David Balfe, Nicky Holland, Virginia Astley and Rolo McGinty of The Woodentops, and was described by 'Trouser Press' as "an exceptionally good record". A second album, 'Liberty', followed in 1985, which proved to be Tate's swansong.
== The Smiths - 'The Troy Tate Sessions' ==
When The Smiths (also on Rough Trade) were looking for a producer for their debut album, Tate was chosen; although after the album was recorded, the band decided to reject these recordings and re-record the album with producer John Porter. The original version of the album is widely known as 'The Troy Tate Sessions' and has only been released on bootlegs. "Jeane" from these sessions was released as the B-side of the "This Charming Man" single, and the version of "Pretty Girls Make Graves" was the B-side to "Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me". Tate's version of "Reel Around the Fountain" had been scheduled for release as a single in 1983, a disc of which was included in a collectors edition of 'Complete' in 2011.

It is located in Anderston,  from Glasgow Airport, three blocks away from Glasgow city centre, and close to the M8 Motorway.  It opened on 30 November 1992.
==Background and construction==
Construction of the hotel began in 1990.  It stands on a site within the Anderston Commercial Zone, an area cleared during the 1960s and designated by the then Glasgow Corporation for "comprehensive development".  Originally the land was earmarked for the second phase of the Anderston Centre complex (early plans show that a public housing tower was planned for the spot where the hotel stands); however, this was abandoned, and the site lay derelict until the late 1980s.
As well as being Hilton's first foray into Glasgow (it later took over the prestigious Stakis Grosvenor in the city's West End, and a third hotel was added to the portfolio in Finnieston), the hotel was notable for being the first high-rise building over 20 storeys to be constructed in Glasgow since its tower block building boom of the 1960s and early 1970s.  The hotel has the largest banqueting hall in the city.
==Famous guests==
The hotel is notable for having accommodated many celebrities, including the former United States President Bill Clinton.  The local actor and comedian Billy Connolly is also a regular guest, and was born a few streets away in the (now demolished) tenements of Anderston.
When American boxer Mike Tyson had a match at nearby Hampden Park, he booked 150 rooms for himself and his entourage.  Hollywood actor Robert Duvall also stayed in one of the hotel's luxury suites for several weeks during filming of the movie 'A Shot at Glory', which was shot in and around the city.
==Award ceremonies==
The Hilton Glasgow has hosted many award ceremonies. Some notable events include:
*'2014 Commonwealth Games' – They were held in Glasgow, Scotland, from 23 July to 3 August 2014 and were the largest multi-sport event ever in Scotland, involving 4,950 athletes from 71 different nations and territories competing in 18 different sports. It was the third time the Commonwealth Games had been held in Scotland, and the 2014 Games were notable for the successes of the Home Nations of the United Kingdom, with England, Wales and hosts Scotland achieving their largest ever gold medal hauls and overall medal hauls at a Commonwealth Games.
*'2014 Ryder Cup' for the '2014 Scottish Golf Awards' – It is one of the biggest sporting events in the world and it was the first time in more than 40 years that the tournament had been staged in Scotland.

==History==
PV 'Vigilant' was a prototype ship designed and built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1937–38. The hull and wheelhouse were constructed entirely of aluminium to save weight. As a result, the  ship had a total displacement of only 106 tons.
It was built for the Department of Trade and Customs, intended for use patrolling waters to the north of Australia in conjunction with the 'Kuru'. It was initially based at Townsville.
==Naval service==
The ship was still undergoing sea trials when it was requisitioned by the Royal Australian Navy in October 1940, commissioning as HMAS 'Vigilant' on 12 November 1940. It was classed as an auxiliary patrol vessel. It was initially equipped with a 3-pounder QF gun but this was replaced with a 20 mm Oerlikon. As well as the mounted gun, it carried a variety of light arms including a Bren light machine gun.
The SS 'Neptuna' explodes during the Bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942. HMAS 'Vigilant' is directly in front of the explosion.
'Vigilant' was transferred to Darwin, Northern Territory in 1941 and was used for protecting the harbour approaches. During the Bombing of Darwin, 'Vigilant' engaged some of the attacking aircraft with its 20 mm Oerlikon and later assisted in picking up survivors from the water in Darwin Harbour.
'Vigilant', with a hold capacity of 7 tons, played an important role in the Battle of Timor from May 1942 and made several supply trips to the island. During one of these supply voyages, it assisted in the search for survivors from HMAS 'Armidale'. During this time, it also resupplied corvettes operating in the Timor Sea with depth charges.
HMAS 'Vigilant' was renamed HMAS 'Sleuth' on 17 April 1944 and HMAS 'Hawk' on 13 March 1945. 'Hawk' was paid off on 12 November 1945.
==Post-war service==
After the war, the ship was returned to the Department of Trade and Customs as PV 'Vigilant', and served as a whaling patrol ship off Western Australia until 1965. Despite attempts to save the ship for preservation, it was scuttled off Sydney in April 1966.
==Legacy==
Vigilant Close in Bentley Park, Queensland is named after HMAS 'Vigilant'.
Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, the RAN decided that, in recognition of the vessel's wartime service, future ships named HMAS 'Vigilant' would be entitled to carry the honours "Darwin 1942–43" and "Pacific 1942–43".

==Background==
Deconstructing her songwriting process, Carey explains: "It was a different experience from an album project. I was very close to the story and in particular my character's struggle, so it made it easier for me as a writer. I just began channeling Krystal's pain and hope." "The song is basically a three-act play and chronicles the evolution of Krystal," says Carey. "I was humming different melodies while I was on the set and stuff," Carey says. "I was just thinking that Willie Nelson would be somebody fabulous to collaborate with. I reached out to him, and we met after one of his concerts."
The song, says Carey, is from the perspective of her 'Tennessee' character Krystal, an aspiring singer. "The song has its own arc," Carey said. "She begins by telling us where she started, like she lays in bed and wonders where she left herself. A lot of people go through that sort of thing. It's kind of about empowerment."
==Release==
The song was released to Adult Contemporary radio on October 20, 2008. The song had already been released on the Canadian iTunes Store. It was digitally released in the U.S. on December 2, 2008.
==Critical reception==
When the 'Los Angeles Times' named "Right to Dream" as a contender for the Academy Award for Best Original Song the paper described the song as "restrained elegance, with some light, finger-picked guitar flourishes and a dash of late-night soul." Forty-nine songs from eligible feature-length motion pictures contended for nominations in the Original Song category for the 81st Academy Awards. "Right to Dream" was on the list, but did not make the final nominations.
==Music video==
A music video was shot and released to promote the single and the film. It premiered on December 8, 2008. The video features clips from the movie as well as shots of Carey in the studio recording the song.

*'Rosie!' is a 1967 American comedy film directed by David Lowell Rich, based on Ruth Gordon's play 'A Very Rich Woman'.
==Plot==
Rosie Lord is a widowed millionaire who, much to the dismay of her daughters Mildred and Edith, spends her money generously. When she announces she intends to buy a $2.5 million closed theater in a run-down part of Los Angeles, because it is the location where her late husband proposed to her and it is now threatened to be turned into a parking lot, her daughters decide that they have had enough. Edith and her husband Cabot complain that they are only granted $100,000 a year, and work together with cold-hearted and recently divorced Mildred to discourage Rosie from buying the theater. They are unable to convince her and her legal advisor Oliver to let them take care of her money, and thus decide to try to declare her incompetent, thereby hoping to put her in an insane asylum. Edith and Cabot's young daughter Daphne is appalled to overhear the scheme, and vows to help her grandmother.
Daphne rushes to Oliver's office, but runs into his much younger associate David Wheelwright, who promises to help her after an emotional conversation. Oliver is upset to find out that one of his workers is taking matters in own hands, and meets with David to hear him out. David advises that they should put someone with Rosie to prevent her from doing anything outrageous, because their daughters are sending a private investigator to the case. Oliver takes his advice, but sends him on the job. David reluctantly starts the job, but is quickly drawn to Rosie's extraverted personality. Simultaneously, he goes on a few romantic dates with Daphne and they fall in love.
After attending a piano recital, Rosie is abducted by two men, and later awakens in a locked rest home for the mentally unstable in the Santa Monica mountains. Rosie is heartbroken to learn that her daughters committed her to a sanitarium, and rejects an offer from Cabot to sign the papers for her release in exchange for making them responsible of her finances. He assures her that they can keep her in the sanitarium indefinitely if she does not obey their wishes, prompting Rosie to reconsider. Meanwhile, Daphne finds out what has happened, and furiously leaves the home, despite her mother's plea not to leave her.
With the help of Oliver and David, Daphne enters the rest home and breaks Rosie out. Rosie, who cannot believe what her own daughters did to her, is next sued in court. Mildred and Edith's lawyer puts Rosie's sanity at debate, and Rosie is ready to announce her defeat during the process. Daphne and Oliver console her during the trial, and when Oliver announces his love for her, Rosie decides to fight again. She faints in court and pretends to be dying, to get her daughters to admit that she is sane (in order for Rosie to change her will just before dying). The case is thereby dismissed and Rosie is now free to marry Oliver.

First performed in the spring of 1894, at the Avenue Theatre in London, where it ran for a little over six weeks, it was the first professional performance of one of Yeats' plays.
== Summary ==
In this theatrical lament on age and thwarted aspirations, a faery child encounters the newlyweds Shawn and Mary Bruin at their home, shared with Maurteen Bruin and Bridget Bruin, Shawn's parents. The child, who at first is thought of by the Bruins as of gentle birth, denounces God and shocks Father Hart. She expounds on the ephemeral nature of life, in a bid to entice the newly-wed Maire to leave with her to  the world of faery:
You shall go with me, newly-married bride,
And gaze upon a merrier multitude.
White-armed Nuala, Aengus of the Birds,
Feacra of the hurtling foam, and him
Who is the ruler of the Western Host,
Finvarra, and their Land of Heart's Desire,
Where beauty has no ebb, decay no flood,
But joy is wisdom, Time an endless song.
I kiss you and the world begins to fade.
Shawn implores the previously listless Maire to remain in the real world, but she dies in his arms, surrendering herself to the laughter and eternal, youthful dance of the otherworld, and to the seductive draw of immortality and mindless joy.

* Shawn Bruin

== Influence ==
The play's title is included on the Coat of Arms of County Sligo, Ireland; where the play is set. The county featured in many of his earlier works and, in accordance with his wishes, Yeats was re-buried in 1948 at Drumcliff, a village overlooked by Ben Bulben.
The title of the album 'Like a Flame' by Frederik Magle is derived from a quote from 'The Land of Heart's Desire'.

*'Standish' is an unincorporated town in Lassen County, California. It is located  southwest of Litchfield, at an elevation of . It lies at the northern terminus of County Route A3 (Standish Buntingville Road) on U.S. Route 395. The name honors Miles Standish.
== History ==
Standish was laid out in 1897, as the second development of the Associated Colonies of New York, whose job was to "create utopian communities in the West". As a part of this project, Standish was designed based on the beliefs of Myles Standish, and the economic structure was designed based on the ideas promoted by LDS leader Brigham Young. The design of the town was supposed to model European communities which had the majority of residents leaving the village during the day in order to work in the nearby fields. When the town was built, it was expected that most of the residents would be farmers with houses separated by at least one hundred feet.  In autumn 1897, the Associated Colonies purchased the properties of Edward T. Purser and his Susan River Irrigation system. Afterwards, the Associated Colonies recruited local people to form the Honey Lake Valley Colonial Club, which would go on to design the Standish Colony. A  site was chosen to build the town on February 5, 1898. It was on February 18, 1898, that the Colonial Irrigation Company of the Honey Lake Valley was incorporated in order to irrigate water for the crops. However, legal problems with the system and water rights caused delay in its operation and the development of Standish; after several legal battles, the courts placed restraints on their irrigation rights. On January 14, 1905, the courts finally ordered the auction of the Colonial Irrigation Company. The post office opened in 1899, having been transferred from Datura.

==References=='Guy Vernon Smith'  (15 October 188011 June 1957) was an Anglican bishop in the mid-20th century.
Smith was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford. Following in the footsteps of his father, a King's Counsel, Smith was called to the Bar in 1905 but then decided on a career move from Law to the Church of England He was ordained in 1907, was a curate in Romford and, from 1909 to 1911, was Chaplain of Oxford House, Bethnal Green. This was 'like a Christian Welfare Society' with 1500 men and 500 boys in clubs, open every night. So began his long association with Arthur Winnington-Ingram, the dynamic Bishop of London. He became Resident Chaplain to the Bishop, and supported the Bishop noted for his jingoistic promotion of British commitment to the Great War. Winnington-Ingram was a renowned preacher who attracted massive publicity, and he toured the Western Front in 1914 with Smith who wrote a book about the visit. Smith himself then served on the Western Front with the Post Office Rifles, distinguishing himself at Bullecourt in June, 1917, winning a Military Cross.
'For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in accompanying a party of volunteers to get in some wounded men that had been lying out some days. He attached himself to the party that had the most dangerous task and greatly encouraged them by his personal example and fearlessness under heavy fire. He was the first to go out and the last to return, setting a splendid example of devotion to duty'
Unfortunately, Smith caught trench nephritis and spent six months in hospital in England. He was, however, fit enough to accompany Winnington-Ingram on a tour of Greece, Salonica, Malta and Rome. He ended the War as a chaplain at Aldershot and then took up an appointment as Rector of Hackney. From 1925 to 1929 he was Archdeacon of Colombo but returned to London at the behest of Winnington-Ingram to be Suffragan Bishop of Willesden. He was consecrated a bishop on the Feast of St James 1929 (25 July), at St Paul's Cathedral by Cosmo Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury. Once again, Smith provided admirable support for Winnington-Ingram whose powers were waning and who did not resign until 1939 when he was in his eighties. The new Bishop of London was Geoffrey Fisher who proposed Smith for the vacant see at Leicester. Although Lang regarded Smith as 'old maidish', he supported Smith's candidature, and Smith was appointed to Leicester in 1940. Smith enjoyed a reputation in Leicester as a 'saintly man', 'with a patient pastoral care and administrative wisdom'. He retired in 1953. He has a commemorative plaque in Leicester Cathedral.

The name is used for a civil parish in the Eden District of Cumbria, England, including the villages of North Stainmore and South Stainmore.  The parish had a population of 253 in the 2001 census, increasing to 264 at the Census 2011. Stainmore Forest stretches further east into County Durham, towards Bowes.
== Geography ==
Stainmore is drained by the River Belah and the River Balder. It is crossed by the Roman road from Bowes to Brough, now part of the A66, and formerly by the Stainmore Railway. Each of these lines of communication has made use of the relatively low broad saddle between the higher hills to north and south which is commonly referred to as the 'Stainmore Gap'.  The summit of the former railway is around  above sea level, though the roads climb to slightly higher elevations. The Gap is coincident with the Stainmore Summit Fault which throws the relatively flat-lying Carboniferous rocks of the area down to the south. It acted as a conduit for Lake District-originated ice to pass eastwards during one or more glacial periods. 
There are several Regionally Important Geological / Geomorphological Sites (RIGS) in the Stainmore area, and Bowes Moor is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The locality gives its name to the Stainmore Trough, a geological structure originating during the Carboniferous period and which lies between the Alston Block to the north and the Askrigg Block to the south.
== History ==
The place-name 'Stainmore' is first attested in a document of circa 990, where it appears as 'Stanmoir'. It appears as 'Stanmore' in the Charter Rolls for the reign of Henry II, and as 'Staynmor' in the Quo Warranto of 1292. The name means 'stony moor'.
According to Roger of Wendover, it was where Eric Bloodaxe (d. 954), recently expelled from York, was betrayed and killed, an event which some historians believe to have taken place in a great battle.
Ancient monuments include a Roman marching camp at 'Rey Cross'  and, immediately east of the camp, the Rey Cross itself (), also called Rere Cross (Scheduled monument, no. 32713).
The Ecclesiastical parish of Brough with Stainmore has two churches: St Michael's, Brough under Stainmore and  St Stephen's, South Stainmore. St Stephen's was built by Cuthbert Buckell in 1600 and rebuilt by Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet in 1842-3.

*'Allen's' was a hamburger joint and nightclub in Athens, Georgia. It was originally established in 1955 in the Normaltown neighborhood of Athens, but was later located at the corner of Hawthorne and Oglethorpe Avenues. It closed in November 2011.
==History==
Allen's was opened by Allen Saine. Saine later sold the business to Athens businessman Billy Slaughter. Slaughter hired Danny Self to run the business and eventually sold it to Self while keeping the real estate.
Allen's got its "World Famous" nickname because of its proximity to the Navy Supply School. The student officers frequented Allen's. They wore Allen's T-shirts in ports all over the world.
In 2002, Self died and Slaughter ended up with the business, eventually closing it in 2004 and later demolishing the building. In 2007, two University of Georgia alumni, Mark Hammond and Hilt Moree, III, acquired the rights to Allen's from Slaughter and re-opened it in a new location with much of the original memorabilia, recipes, and live music. It was located on Hawthorne Avenue, across the street from the Athens YMCA location but still on the edge of Normaltown. There were various pieces of local memorabilia framed on the walls.  Allen's closed for the final time on November 29, 2011.
==Notable patrons and employees==
Zell Miller worked there while attending the University of Georgia before going on to become a Governor and later a U.S. Senator.
Notable patrons of Allen's include the late writer Lewis Grizzard, professional wrestler Bill Goldberg, lead guitarist/singer John Bell of Athens band Widespread Panic, R.E.M. lead singer Michael Stipe, residents of the world-famous "Annex" including Doug Callas, Britt Murrill (who also dominated the Cyclone pinball machine), Scott Poole, Chip Zimmerman, and Chris Lee, and The B-52's who namechecked Allen's in their 1989 single "Deadbeat Club": "Going down to Allen's for a 25 cent beer."

*'The Meaning of Witchcraft' is a non-fiction book written by Gerald Gardner.  Gardner, known to many in the modern sense as the "Father of Wicca", based the book around his experiences with the religion of Wicca and the New Forest Coven. It was first published in 1959, only after the British Parliament repealed the Witchcraft Act of 1735, and proved to be Gardner's final book. The Wicca religion as expounded by Gardner was focused on a goddess, identified with the night sky and with wild nature, and a horned god who represented the fertilizing powers of the natural world. It was organized into covens, through which members were initiated through three ascending degrees of competence and authority and which were governed by a high priestess, supported by a high priest.   More historical context to the pagan practice of Wicca can be found in the book 'Wicca: History, Belief, and Community in Modern Pagan Witchcraft' That book discusses Wiccan life, covering how and why people convert to Wicca; its denominations; its sociological demographics; its political beliefs, particularly in terms of environmentalist issues; the impact of anti-Wiccan persecution; the transmission of Wiccan and Pagan culture; and the history of academic analysis of Wicca.
'The Meaning of Witchcraft' is a sequel to Gardner's previous book on the subject, 'Witchcraft Today', which was published in 1954. Chapters include: Witch's Memories and Beliefs, The Stone Age Origins of Witchcraft, Druidism and the Aryan Celts, Magic Thinking, Curious Beliefs about Witches, Signs and Symbols, The Black Mass, Some Allegations Examined. When Gardner died in 1964, the copyright for the book was left to the High Priestess of his coven, Monique Wilson.
Gardner wrote the book in order to publicise Wicca, which he believed would die out unless more converts could be attracted. Gardner himself believed that Wicca was the survival of an ancient pagan Witch-cult, a theory originating from historian Margaret Murray which has now largely been discredited by historians like Ronald Hutton and Jeffrey Russell. Margaret Murray's theory maintained that witches were indeed members of an organized cult surviving from pagan times. According to Murray, Christianity remained a thin veneer which cloaked pagan customs down to the sixteenth century.  Hutton does say that all the modern branches of Wicca are either based on or influenced by his (Gardner) teachings. It is the only complete religion (as opposed to sect or denomination) which England has ever given the world.

And believe me, this is a brief summary and that could also include the concerts with the Garage Fuzz, which is vocalist. Banda who is not by chance, will play in Porto Alegre a day after the opening of her exhibition. If a few years ago it seemed things Sespas was doing more to a human being and could explode at any time in 2008 proves that he definitely is not human. Determined and focused entirely on its 300 projects (!?), the multi-artist is more functional than ever. In "re_functional," the new single in the adhesive, the gauchos can see live for the first time their works of art in collage, a technique that makes ever more sense for someone immersed in so many references. They work visually dense, physically and conceptually thick schizophrenic, media tilts caused by SESP. It is the reupgrade a paster of paper that began Fanzine and pasting posters of shows, came to pervade the streets with their stickers and posters of art and now investigates the subconscious with the meticulous collages and full of overlaps produced in his studio.

Graffiti artist Sesper has been getting his hands dirty as producer on an as-yet-unreleased DVD documentary called Re.board on the history of Brazilian skate art which features jacks of the trade Fabio Bitao, Billy Argel and Ragueb Rogerio, who talk about the discipline’s development and shows what all the goodness they’ve done to push it forward.

Not only does it draw the biggest names from the discipline (Ornesto, Herbert Baglione, Carlos Dias) in the country but also matches them with their international peers like Mike Mills, Cheryl Dunn and KAWS. A group of star curators including Sesper and Christian Strike has brought over the amazing Beautiful Losers tour as one segment of the show, bringing the overall participant total to 300 works by 100 artists. The other three parts of Transfer discuss street art: how it’s documented by photographs and film, accessories to the scene, such as skate and publications, and work that has transcended the street and entered more defined art and cultural spaces.

*The 'Armstrong Breech Loading 20-pounder gun', later known as 'RBL 20-pounder', was an early modern 3.75-inch rifled breech-loading light gun of 1859.
== History ==
The gun was effectively a larger version of the successful RBL 12 pounder 8 cwt Armstrong gun. There were different versions for land and sea service.
=== Sea service ===
13 cwt boat gun at Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence
The RBL 20 pounder of 13 cwt and 15 cwt for sea service was introduced in 1859. It is 2½ feet shorter than the land version giving it a bore of only 54 inches (14.43 calibres), and hence a short stubby appearance. Its short barrel only allowed it to attain a muzzle velocity of 1,000 ft/second.
The 15 cwt gun, identifiable by the raised coil in front of the vent slot, was intended for broadside use in sloops. The more lightly constructed 13 cwt gun was known as a pinnace gun and was intended for boat use.
=== Land service ===
The RBL 20 pounder of 16 cwt for land service was introduced in 1860. It has a bore of 84 inches (22.36 calibres) and hence has the appearance of a typical field gun. After it became obsolete for regular Royal Artillery use, a small number were re-issued to Volunteer Artillery 'Batteries of Position' from 1889, alongside 16-pounder RML guns and 40 Pounder RBL guns. The 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme shows the allocation of twelve Artillery Volunteer position batteries equipped with 20 Pounder guns which would be concentrated in Epping, Essex in the event of mobilisation.

R.B.L. gun of 16-cwt. on garrison sliding carriage and on travelling carriage, 1892, 1896'Double-muscled cattle' refers to breeds of cattle that carry one of seven known mutations that limits and reduces the activity of the myostatin protein.  Normally, myostatin limits the number of muscle fibers present at birth, and interfering with activity of this protein causes animals to be born with higher numbers of muscle fibers, consequently augmenting muscle growth. Additionally, these mutations reduce the superficial and internal fat deposits, causing the meat to be less marbled and lower in fat content.  Animals homozygous for myostatin mutation (inheriting a mutant copy of myostatin from both sire and dam) also have improved meat tenderness in some cuts of meat.  The enlarged muscles of dam and calf at birth leads to increased difficulty of calving, and in some breeds frequently necessitates birth by cesarean section.
== History ==
Some breeds of cattle don’t possess the myostatin gene that helps regulate muscle growth. This causes them to have more muscle mass and yields more meat for the cattle farmers. Two of the breeds that possess the double muscle gene are the Piedmontese and the Parthenais. The Piedmontese was discovered in Italy 1897, and the Parthenais were found in France in 1893. The Belgian Blue is another cattle that can lack myostatin and have double muscles. The Belgian Blue originates from central and upper Belgium. The breed was established in the early 20th century. The Belgian Blue was once divided into two strains, one for beef and the other for milk. The Belgian Blue is now primarily beef. The Belgian blue is relatively new to the U.S. but has gained acceptance from breeders.
Myostatin was discovered by Se-Jin Lee and Alexander McPherron in 1997. They found that myostatin was lacking in mice and causes the size of the mice to increase by two or three times the size of mice that didn’t lack the myostatin. Later that year McPherron and Lee also saw that Piedmontese and Belgian Blue cattle were hypermuscular. The cattle had naturally occurring disruption of myostatin locus. Dr. Lee went on to extensively study myostatin. During this research he noted the loss of white fat that occurred when hyper muscularity by myostatin would happen. He also showed that myostatin was sufficient to cause a phenotype reminiscent of cachexia. “Dr. Lee has shown that other molecules in the TGF-B pathways, notably the activins and follistatin, also regulate muscle mass.”  Dr. Lee’s contributions also demonstrated so potential that myostatin could be therapeutic, the clinical setting that myostatin blockade would be useful has not yet been found but it may be beneficial in some areas. People are now trying to use myostatin as a medicine. “The research has produced several muscle-building drugs now being tested in people with medical problems, including muscular dystrophy, cancer and kidney disease”.
Double-muscled breeding is done to get more meat and less fat. Backfat is generally found to be less in double-muscled cattle than in cattle with normal muscling. (Bailey, Mears, & Mir). Animals that are double-muscled have a higher carcass yield but this does come with new problems for the cattle. The meat from double muscled cattle is tenderer. “There is a persisting trend to improve carcass quality in specialized beef breeds. A higher meat yield and more lean meat are desirable for the meat industry.”

*  Official website'JDTic' is a selective, long-acting ("inactivating") antagonist of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR). JDTic is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative, distantly related structurally to analgesics such as pethidine and ketobemidone, and more closely to the MOR antagonist alvimopan. In addition, it is structurally distinct from other KOR antagonists such as norbinaltorphimine.
==Pharmacology==
JDTic is a long-acting ("inactivating") antagonist of the KOR, and is highly selective for the KOR over the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and nociceptin receptor (NOP). It has a very long duration of action, with effects in animals seen for up to several weeks after administration of a single dose, although its binding to the KOR is not technically "irreversible" and its long-acting effects are instead caused by altered activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinases.
Animal studies suggest that JDTic may produce antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anti-stress effects, as well as having possible application in the treatment of addiction to cocaine and morphine. JDTic shows robust activity in animal models of depression, anxiety, stress-induced cocaine relapse, and nicotine withdrawal.
The high affinity of JDTic for the KOR suggested that it might be a suitable ligand for promoting the crystallization of this receptor for X-ray crystallographic studies. Such experiments were successful and lead to the publication of the first report of a high-resolution structure of an opioid receptor   .
==Discontinuation==
During phase I human clinical trials for the treatment of cocaine abuse, development of JDTic was halted due to the incidence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, a type of arrhythmia that can potentially be life-threatening. In addition, JDTic showed an unfavorable brain-to-plasma concentration ratio, indicating poor central nervous system penetration. As a result, new KOR antagonists with more favorable drug profiles (e.g., short-acting, improved brain penetration, etc.), such as ALKS-5461 (a combination of buprenorphine and samidorphan) and CERC-501 (formerly LY-2456302), are being developed instead.
The discontinuation of the clinical development of JDTic is detailed in the following important literature quote:
In the same paper, LY-2456302 (now CERC-501) was described, "The LY2456302 compound developed by Eli Lilly is an example of a KOR antagonist that does not strongly activate JNK. In a recent phase 1 trial of LY2456302, the authors concluded that the drug was well-tolerated with no clinically significant findings (Lowe et al, 2014)." Note that KOR antagonists that strongly activate JNK are inactivating (long-acting) while those that do not are non-inactivating (short-acting), and that inactivating KOR antagonists are more "complete" and hence potentially more risky inhibitors of the KOR than are non-inactivating antagonists.

==Geography==
St Breock village is 1 mile (1.6 km) west of Wadebridge immediately to the south of the Royal Cornwall Showground. The village lies on the eastern slope of the wooded Nansent valley. The civil parish of St Breock is in Bodmin Registration District and the population in the 2001 census was 703, increasing to 725 at the 2011 census. The parish extends approx five miles (8 kilometres) south of Wadebridge. To the north, the parish is bounded by the River Camel, to the west by St Issey parish, to the northeast by Egloshayle parish and to the southeast by Lanivet parish. Together with Egloshayle it was one of the two parishes within which the town of Wadebridge developed.
==Prehistory==
St Breock Downs Monolith
Around two miles south of the village stands the St Breock Downs Monolith, a 16 ft (5 m) high prehistoric standing stone. It is the largest and heaviest prehistoric standing stone in Cornwall. Around one mile northwest of the monolith is a prehistoric dolmen known as Pawton Quoit.
==Manor of Pawton==
The Manor of Pawton, already established in Saxon times, was very large, extending to six whole parishes and parts of four others. It was granted to the Bishops of Sherborne by King Egbert of Wessex and held by their successors until it was alienated under Henry VIII. In 1086 there were 44 hides of land, land for 60 ploughs, 40 villagers and 40 smallholders; pasture 12 sq leagues, woodland 2 sq leagues. Charles G. Henderson wrote in 1925 that slight remains of the bishop's palace and deer park were still to be seen. On the down above Pawton is a very large barrow with massive dolmen. At Nanscowe Farm a pillar stone of the 5th or 6th century with inscription meaning 'To the son of Ulcagnus; and to Severus' (in Latin).
==Parish Church==
The parish church  is dedicated to St Briocus and dates back to the 13th century although it was extensively rebuilt in 1677. (The aisle, south transept and porches are additions of the 15th and 16th centuries.) The church has a battlemented tower with a ring of five bells. It is situated beside the stream in the valley bottom and in 1965 suffered damage in a major flood. The nave is longer than usual in a parish church: this may be connected to the fact that the Bishops of Exeter owned the manor of Pawton before the Reformation and had a palace there. In 1790 the rector here was John Molesworth and his wife Catherine Molesworth was an amateur artist. The church was restored for £1,400, and reopened on 26 July 1881 by Edward Benson, the Bishop of Truro.
The church contains some fine monuments to members of the Tredeneck family and one of 1598 to William and Jane Viell. The heirs of the Viell family in the 17th century were the Prideaux family of Prideaux Place, which still owned the manor of St Breock in 1968. There is a brass probably also to a Tredeneck, ca. 1520. The church organ was the work of 'Father' Willis. Seth Ward, afterwards a bishop, was briefly the incumbent here.

==External links=='Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy' is a rare genetic condition characterized by reduced body fat and increased skeletal muscle size. Affected individuals have up to twice the usual amount of muscle mass in their bodies, but increases in muscle strength are not usually congruent. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is not known to cause medical problems, and affected individuals are intellectually normal. The prevalence of this condition is unknown.
Mutations in the 'MSTN' gene cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. The 'MSTN' gene provides instructions for making a protein called myostatin, which is active in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) both before and after birth. This protein normally restrains muscle growth, ensuring that muscles do not grow too large. Mutations that reduce the production of functional myostatin lead to an overgrowth of muscle tissue. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy has a pattern of inheritance known as incomplete autosomal dominance. People with a mutation in both copies of the gene in each cell (homozygotes) have significantly increased muscle mass. People with a mutation in one copy of the 'MSTN' gene in each cell (heterozygotes) also have increased muscle bulk but to a lesser degree.
The effect of this growth factor was first described in cattle as “bovine muscular hypertrophy” by the British farmer H. Culley in 1807. Cattle that have a myostatin gene deletion look unusually and excessively muscular.
==Human-induced myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy==
Researchers at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health in China have edited the genome of beagles to create double the amount of muscle. Of the two beagles that were genetically modified, only one had increased muscle mass. The ultimate aim of this project is to be able to better treat a genetic neuromuscular disease (Parkinson's disease).
Besides beagles, genetic modification has also been done in pigs and fish.

==Language==
The Djargurd Wurrung people spoke the Djargurd Wurrung dialect of the Dhauwurd Wurrung language.
==Country==
The classification of the Groups on this territory has been subject to controversy. Norman Tindale, referring to the same area, and clans, called them the Kirrae, whose lands he stated comprised in his estimate around  of territory from Warrnambool and the Hopkins River down to the coast at Princetown with the northerly reaches at Lake Bolac and Darlington, and extending easterly beyond Camperdown. The historian Ian Clark states that Tindale "failed to acknowledge the existence" of the Djargurd wurrung, while locating them in the same area. The Djagurd wurrung territory was bordered by the Wada wurrung in the north, the Dhauwurd wurrung to the west, the Girai wurrung to their south, and the Gulidjan in the east.
==History==
The traditional lands of the Djargurd Wurrung and Gulidjan, including the Western District Lakes, now a Ramsar site, have been used by the indigenous peoples for thousands of years. There are many archaeological sites registered that include fish traps, surface scatters, middens and burial sites.
At the time of European settlement in the 1830s and 1840s the Djargurd suffered from massacres by European settlers in the Australian frontier wars, and also from attacks by the neighbouring Wada wurrung tribe. Dispossession from their land led to starvation and their theft of sheep resulted in murderous reprisals. In 1839 one clan, the 'Tarnbeere gundidj', was massacred by Frederick Taylor and others in a site that came to be known as Murdering Gully.
When the Aboriginal reserve was established in 1865 at Framlingham, near Warrnambool, many of the surviving members of the Djargurd wurrung were forcibly relocated. However, a number of elders refused to abandon their traditional country and stayed eking out a meagre living on the edge of towns like Camperdown. They were assisted by people such as James Dawson, a Scotsman, who acted as guardian and supported them with his own money.
In 1883 Wombeetch Puuyuun (also known as Camperdown George) died at the age of 43 and was buried in a bog outside the bounds of Camperdown Cemetery. On Dawson's return from a trip to Scotland he was shocked at where his friend had been buried and personally reburied Wombeetch in Camperdown Cemetery. He appealed for money to raise a monument, but with little public support, primarily funded the monument himself. The  obelisk was erected as a memorial to Wombeetch Puuyuun and the Aboriginal people of the district, and has been described as still inspiring today.
==Clan system==
The Djargurd wurrung people had 12 clans under a matrilineal system with a descent system based on the Gabadj (black cockatoo) and Grugidj (white cockatoo) moieties. The clans intermarried with Gulidjan, Girai wurring, Djab wurrung and Wada wurrung peoples.

*'Iggesund Paperboard' is a commission company of the Holmen Group and Europe's third largest manufacturer of high quality virgin fibre paperboard. Iggesund has a market share of about 20% in this sector.
==History==
Iggesund is an industrial village in Sweden. Isak Breant Sr, a businessman and former court commissioner to Queen Kristina, established there a mill in 1685. Iggesunds Bruk (English:mill) was originally an ironworks, and the nearby forests were used to produce charcoal for the factory. In 1771, Iggesund Bruk acquired a small nearby company that made paper, Östanå paper mill. It was one of the first to try to use sawdust and wood to produce paper. However, the technique remained experimental. The mill burnt down in 1842. In 1869, Baron Gustav Tamm became the owner of Iggesunds Bruk, and built a large sawmill. It was a major transformation for the factory, which had always been an ironworks. 
Iggesund's shares were first listed on Stockholmsbörsen in 1949. Lars G. Sundblad introduced paperboard manufacturing at Iggesund, which started in 1963. The merger of MoDo, Holmen and Iggesund resulted in the delisting of Iggesund shares from Stockholmsbörsen (1988), making Iggesund part of the holding, which was renamed to Holmen AB in 2000 
==Products==
Iggesund Paperboard's product range consists of two product families:
*'Invercote', a solid bleached board (SBB, GZ) with a grammage of 180–400 g/m2 and a thickness of 200-485 μm

The firm was founded by 'Will Carter' (24 September 1912 – 17 March 2001), publishing its first book in 1936, and was continued by his son, 'Sebastian Carter' (b. 1941), from 1966.
== History ==
Rampant Lions started life as a private press in 1924, when Will Carter was still a schoolboy. After the war, his interest in printing was such that he decided to try to establish the Press on a commercial footing, and did so in Cambridge in 1949. From that date until the formal closure of the Press at the end of 2008, Rampant Lions has been among the most highly regarded letterpress printing-offices in Britain. The skills of Will and Sebastian Carter in design and press-work have been recognized by publishers, who commissioned work from them, and by collectors, who have sought out their publications since the 1950s. Sebastian Carter also has an international reputation as a writer on type and typography and is the author of several books, including in 2013 'The Rampant Lion Press: A Narrative Catalogue'.
Besides printing, Carter also designed two fonts for Monotype, Klang and Octavian, the latter with David Kindersley. He also designed signage and a font for Dartmouth College, where he was artist-in-residence for a time.
==Legacy==
At the Fitzwilliam Museum from 18 March to 18 May 2014 the exhibition 'The Rampant Lions Press: A Letterpress Odyssey' took place, featuring books published since 1982, when the press had been the subject of a retrospective exhibition there, celebrating 'A Printing Workshop Through Five Decades'.

==Academic career==
Berwick was educated at a small private school before entering Bradford Grammar School. He completed his schooling in 1906, securing a Brown Scholarship to assist him in his university studies; he was also awarded an Entrance Scholarship by Clare College, Cambridge, where he went to study for the Mathematical Tripos. He took Part I of the degree in 1909, placing joint fourth in the class, and Part II in 1910.
During his undergraduate years, under the tutelage of G B Matthews, Berwick became interested in number theory. He submitted an essay entitled 'An illustration of the theory of relative corpora' for the Smith's Prize in 1911; the essay was placed second in the prize competition. He then co-wrote, with Matthews, a paper 'On the reduction of arithmetical binary cubics which have a negative determinant': it was published after Berwick had left Cambridge to take up an assistant lectureship at the University of Bristol, and was the only paper Berwick co-authored in his career.
Berwick taught at Bristol until 1913 when he took up another lectureship at the University College of Bangor. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Berwick began war work on the Technical Staff of the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section of the Munitions Inventions Department at Portsmouth. For the 1919–20 academic year Berwick was appointed acting head of the Bangor mathematics department; he then took up a lectureship at the University of Leeds, earning promotion to a Readership in Mathematical Analysis there in 1921. He was also elected to a fellowship at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1921.
In 1926, with thirteen research papers to his name, Berwick returned to Bangor to serve as Chairman of Mathematics. He had in 1925 become a member of the Council of the London Mathematical Society; in 1929 he was appointed Vice-President. He retired the post in 1941, at which point he was created Emeritus Professor.
==Research and publications==
Berwick was an algebraist, and worked on the problem of computing an integral basis for the algebraic integers in a simple algebraic extension of the rationals, and studied rings in algebraic integers. In 1927 he published 'Integral Bases', an ambitious account that used heavy numerical computations in place of practical proofs. 
He published sixteen papers, ten of them — including a 1915 paper giving sufficient conditions for a quintic expression to be solved by radicals — in 'Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'. Much of his work gained recognition only in the 1960s, when it was republished.
==Personal life==
Berwick was described as a tall man with a distinctive voice and forthright personal style. He was a keen chess player, participating in the clubs at his various universities. He had a keen interest in teaching, publishing a number of mathematical recreation articles and giving several addresses at meetings of the British Association.
In 1923, while living in Leeds, Berwick married Daisy May Thomas, the daughter of Dr W R Thomas. His health began to fail after his 1926 return to Bangor; he published only five further papers after taking up this position. He died in Bangor in 1944.
==Legacy==
Berwick endowed funds for two prizes to the London Mathematical Society; after his death they were used to create the Senior Berwick prize and Junior Berwick prize, both of which are still awarded.
==References=='Coelacanthopsis' is an extinct genus of lobe-finned fish which lived during the Carboniferous period.
The Coelacanth is the only living example of the fossil Coelacanth fishes Actinistia. They are also the closest link between fish and the first amphibian creatures which made the transition from sea to land in the Devonian period (408-362 Million Years Ago). That such a creature could have existed for so long is nearly incredible, but some say that the cold depths of the West Indian Ocean at which the Coelacanth thrives, and the small number of predators it has, may have helped the species survive eons of change.
The Coelacanth was first discovered in 1938 by Marjorie Courtenay Latimer, the curator of a small museum in the port town of East London, as she was visiting a fisherman who would let her search through his boat's catch for interesting specimens. Ironically, Marjorie was only visiting the sea captain to wish him a happy Christmas when she first spotted the Coelacanth's oddly shaped, blue-gray fin protruding from beneath a mountain of fish.  Marjorie brought back the specimen to the museum where she compared it against images of known species, and ultimately realized what she had was no ordinary fish. 
After sending a rough drawing of the fish to Professor J.L.B. Smith, at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, who in turn confirmed that the creature she had discovered on the boat's deck was indeed a prehistoric fish, a Coelacanth to be exact.
Since then, Coelacanth populations have been found near Indonesia, South Africa, and other unexpected places.  While there have been enough sightings of the creature to indicate that there is more than one area where the species exists, it remains a highly protected and mysterious animal, a living fossil which may, or may not be the only creature from our past which has survived millions of years of evolution.
Some place it in the family Rhabdodermatidae.
==References=='Germania Brötzingen' was a German association football club from the district of Brötzingen in Pforzheim, Baden-Württemberg. Together with the 1. FC Pforzheim and VfR Pforzheim, it was one of three clubs in the city who have played higher league football.
On 1 July 2011, the club merged with 1. FC Eutingen to form SV Kickers Pforzheim, with the new side playing in the tier seven Landesliga.
==History==
The club was established in December 1906 as 'Fuβball-Club Germania Brötzingen'. In 1913, it was merged briefly with 'Ballspielclub 05 Brötzingen' as 'BC Germania Pforzheim', but the union quickly fell apart. Following World War I, in 1920, several clubs including 'Turnverein Brötzingen', 'KSV Achilles Brötzingen', and 'Radfahrclub Sturm Brötzingen' joined with 'FC' to create the current club.
'FC' enjoyed a steady string of successes in local play that soon saw the club promoted to the senior regional circuit, the 'Kreisliga Südwest' and then the 'Bezirksliga Württemberg-Baden', where they took part in qualification for the national playoff round in 1928–29. Following the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich into 16 top flight divisions, 'Brötzingen' became part of the Gauliga Baden. A poor campaign led to the
club's demotion after their debut season, but they returned to the Gauliga to play three more seasons between 1935–38.
After World War II, 'FC' became part of the Amateurliga Nordbaden-Süd, later the Amateurliga Baden (II), where they fared poorly through the late 40s and 50s. The side improved in the 60s and enjoyed local title and cup wins on their way to promotion to the Amateurliga Nordbaden (III) in 1968. 'FC' was relegated after a 16th-place result there in 1971 and returned to the Bezirksliga (VIII) level.
Spending its final four seasons at Kreisliga level, where the side achieved a second-place finish in 2011, the club eventually disappeared through a merger with 1. FC Eutingen to form SV Kickers Pforzheim on 1 July 2011.

==References=='Meshterski' () or 'Meshtrenski' (мещренски) was a cant, or secret sociolect, of the south Bulgarian builders, bricklayers and masons. The name comes from the word мещра 'meshtra', "master", from Latin 'magister'. Meshterski served a linguistically isolating purpose, enabling the builders to communicate in secrecy, and a socially isolating purpose, emphasizing the builders' perceived supremacy over their contractors.
==Distribution and vocabulary==
The sociolect emerged among the Bulgarian masons in southwestern Macedonia, adjacent to the Albanian lands. As a result, it includes a large number of Albanian loanwords, e.g. бука 'buka', "bread", from 'bukё'; гяхта 'gyahta', "cheese", from 'djathë'; мерам 'meram', "to take", from 'marr'. There are much fewer loans from Greek (e.g. лашма 'lashma', "mud", from λάσπη 'laspi'; карекла 'karekla', "chair", from καρέκλα 'karékla') and Turkish (e.g. пиринч 'pirinch', "rice", from 'pirinç'; сакал 'sakal', "beard", from 'sakal'). Later, the language spread through migration to northeastern Macedonia (the region of Gotse Delchev), the Rhodope Mountains around Smolyan, and the areas of Asenovgrad, Kazanlak and the sub-Balkan valleys.
Although loanwords often remained semantically unchanged, the Bulgarian vocabulary in the sociolect was substituted with native metaphors, metonyms and words from different roots, so as to conceal the true meaning to outsiders, e.g. мокра 'mokra' ("wet", fem.) for вода 'voda', "water"; гледач 'gledach' ("looker") for око 'oko', "eye", обло 'oblo' ("round", neut.) for яйце 'yaytse', "egg". The lexis of Meshterski included not only professional terms and basic vocabulary, but also other words, including religious terms, such as Светлив 'Svetliv', "Luminous", referring to God or a saint.
Meshterski also spread to other social areas: it was borrowed by tinsmiths in at least one village in the Rhodopes, although with a much reduced vocabulary and renamed to 'Ganamarski'. Albanian words mediated through Meshterski have also entered informal Bulgarian; these included кекав 'kekav', "weak, sickly" (from 'keq'); кинти 'kinti', "money, dough" (from 'qind', "hundred"), скивам 'skivam', "to see, to take a look" (from 'shqyrtoj'), келеш 'kelesh', "squirt, mangy fellow" (from 'qelesh').

*  Short dictionary of Meshterski'Kivlemøyane' (English: 'The Kivle Maids')  is the popular name of three dairy maids in Seljord, Telemark, who according to legend were turned to stone. Their image is presented in a natural formation in the mountain of Skorve in the valley Kivledalen. The legend also formed the basis for a number of Norwegian folk tunes.
==The legend==
This Norwegian legend tells of three maids who played their clarions during mass. Their music was so beautiful that all the attendants were distracted, and went out to listen to them instead of the priest. This angered the priest, who cursed the girls and turned them to stone. They are still visible in the mountain. After some sources, the minister involved was the last Roman Catholic priest in Seljord. The legend presents an orphic theme, and also indicates that the maids may have been seductive forest creatures ('Hulders').
==Music connected to the legend==
There are a number of folk tunes and dance tunes connected to this legend. In Seljord, a regular suite was performed and preserved, consisting of four separate tunes. The music was played on  Willow flute  and Hardanger fiddle. Many of the dances are fairly old. Most of this music derives from Seljord, and has been played in unbroken tradition from local fiddlers. Classical composer Edvard Grieg  (1843–1907)  arranged one of those dances for piano, and composer Eivind Groven (1901–1977) played and arranged another. There are in all some twelve to fifteen tunes sorted in three separate suites connected to the legend.
==Art connected to the legend==
The legend was first recorded by Andreas Faye (1802–1869) who published  'Norske Folke-Sagn', a collection of Norwegian tales and legends in 1837. Later, versions of the tale is recorded by a number of folklorists, among then Magnus Brostrup Landstad, Rikard Berge and Knut Loupedalen. This version is from a collection of Norwegian folk tales and legends dated 1995 
The folk tunes connected to the story were collected by Eivind Groven and Arne Bjørndal, as well as Johan Halvorsen.
Kivlemøyane was also featured in paintings by Norwegian illustrator and  painter Johanna Bugge Berge (1874-1961).

==References=='FV 'Ekawat Nava 5' was a hijacked Kiribati-flagged, Thai-owned deep-sea fishing trawler that was sunk by  of the Indian Navy on 18 November 2008. The trawler sank when a fire broke out on the vessel after INS 'Tabar' retaliated to being fired upon by pirates on board. All but one crew member of the trawler were believed killed.
==Accounts of the incident==
'Ekawat Nava 5' had a crew of 15 Thais and one Cambodian. It was travelling from Oman to Yemen when it was hijacked on 18 November 2008.
On the evening of 18 November, INS 'Tabar' was on patrol  southwest of Salalah, Oman (near ), when it spotted the hijacked trawler. The vessel was identified by the frigate as a pirate mother ship, as it had two speed boats in tow and men armed with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and assault rifles on its deck. The frigate ordered the trawler to be boarded for inspection. Upon being refused and threatened by the pirates, the frigate continued to follow the trawler.
The official account from the Indian Navy states that the pirates fired at the frigate with an RPG. The frigate fired back in retaliation. Explosions were later heard on board the trawler, possibly due to ammunition or fuel stored on its deck. The trawler sank as a result of the fire.
The Indian Navy reported that following the fire on board the vessel, it spotted only the two speed boats fleeing from the scene. It pursued the boats and found one abandoned. It lost track of the other boat in the darkness.
An account of the incident narrated by the Thai representative of its owner, Sirichai Fisheries, based on information provided by a surviving Thai crew member, states that Somali pirates had boarded and just taken control of the trawler when INS 'Tabar' arrived on the scene. The crewmember's account stated that the trawler had not been used as a pirate mother ship.
Of the original crewmembers of the trawler, the only survivor was picked up by a passing merchant vessel, one was later confirmed dead, while 14 others were reported missing by the owner. The crew of INS 'Tabar' reported seeing only the two motor boats fleeing from the scene of the incident in the darkness. They did not spot any of the original crew of the trawler. The fate of the remaining crew was unknown.
An account of the incident from the US Department of State, may have originally stated that the Indian Navy captured some of the pirates. This was however not confirmed by the Indian Navy.

*'Serenianus' (died in Lydia, 366) was an officer of the Roman Empire, involved in the death of Caesar Constantius Gallus and in the usurpation of Procopius.
== Biography ==
Coin of Constantius Gallus, the caesar that Serenianus executed in Pula.
Serenianus was born in Pannonia. attended at the court of Roman Emperor Constantius II (337-361). It is known that he had been a former general, in charge of the defence of Phoenicia, whose laxity had been the reason for the devastation of the city of Celsein. He was put under trial for treason: he had sent one of his men with an enchanted hat to ask oracles on the Emperor's life. However, even if the charge was demonstrated, he was declared not guilty, thanks to his friends.
In 354 he was sent to Pula, where Caesar Constantius Gallus was under trial for treason, to tell the prisoner that he had been condemned to death; then, together with Apodemius and Pentadius, he executed the Caesar.
In 364, Emperor Valentinian I proclaimed his brother Valens co-emperor. The two rulers divided among themselves the army and the officers. In this occasion, Serenianus, who had been returned to the reserve for long time, entered at Valens' service as 'comes domesticorum' ("commander of the imperial bodyguard").
Siliqua of Procopius (365-366). Serenianus was loyal to Emperor Valens and fought against Procopius, but was killed during that war.
In 366 he was killed by Marcellus, 'protector' of usurper Procopius, who, in 365, rebelled against Emperor Valens. The story is told differently by the two sources survived, Ammianus Marcellinus and Zosimus.
According to Ammianus, Serenianus stayed loyal to Valens. That year Serenianus went to Cyzicus, where he found that an imperial officer called Venustus had brought in that city, for fear of the usurper, the money to pay the troops; Serenianus, confident in the city garrison and in the strength of the city walls, fortified in Cizycus. To obtain that money, Procopius collected a strong army and put under siege Cyzicus, capturing the city and Serenianus, who was sent, as a prisoner, to Nicaea. After Procopius was killed, Marcellus, who was in command of the garrison of Nicaea, during the night entered the Palace, where Serenianus was held, and killed him.
According to Zosimus, who follows Eunapius, Serenianus was in Bithynia, leading some cavalry units, and Procopius sent Marcellinus to Bithynia to neutralize this menace. Serenianus occupied Cyzicus, but Marcellinus put under siege and captured the city, pursued the fleeing Serenianus in Lydia and killed him.
Ammianus had a mad opinion of Serenianus, whom he describes rude and cruel, and says that Marcellus' only merit was to have killed Serenianus and saved thus many lives, as Serenianus, once free, would have damaged many people.

== History ==
Kenzo Takada was born in Japan and moved to Paris in 1964 to start his fashion career. He then became known for using Asian and Japanese influenced style with the construction of European fashion. He started with a 'Jungle Jap' boutique located at Galerie Vivienne and decorated in jungle inspired decor. He began with handmade women's clothing; reportedly, he made his first collection with $200 worth of fabrics bought at a large discount house in Montmartre. The brand became Kenzo after a fashion show in New York in 1976, as the American market considered 'Jungle Jap' too pejorative. 
In 1983, Kenzo started designing men and then kids and home collections in 1987, followed by fragrances in 1988.  
In 1993, luxury-products maker LVMH acquired Kenzo from SEBP and Financière Truffaut for about $80 million. From 1995, Kenzo also produced Kenzo Studio, a line was produced through a licensing agreement with the Bonaventure Group. While Kenzo developed the line’s fashion direction, Studio was sold only in the U.S. and Kenzo retail stores in China.
In October 1999, Kenzo Takada resigned as the brand's creative director. From 1999 until 2003, Gilles Rosier and Roy Krejberg designed the women's and men's lines, respectively.
From 2006 until 2008, over 100 of Kenzo's stores worldwide were refurbished.
From 2008 until 2011, Antonio Marras served as Kenzo's creative director, overseeing the brand in its entirety. By 2011, Kenzo barely broke even, with annual sales estimated at about 150 million euros ($197.4 million). 
By 2017, Kenzo built the accessories and shoe business to almost 30 percent of revenues. In 2019, Kenzo ended its distribution agreement with I.T to take back control of its 35 stores in China via a joint venture with the same partner. 
On June 25, 2020, Kenzo unveiled its first American flagship store in SoHo, Manhattan. 
== Role in popular culture ==
In 2012, designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim unveiled a knitted sweater with a tiger graphic on it for Kenzo's Fall 2012 collection. Leon wanted to make a sweatshirt version of the sweater for him to wear. Despite initial resistance from Kenzo's design team, the tiger sweatshirts became extremely popular, with the initial run of sweatshirts selling out within hours at Kenzo's Paris location. Since 2011, the tiger shirt and clothing designed by Leon and Lim has been worn by celebrities and fashion bloggers including Jay Z, Kevin Hart, Beyoncé, Zooey Deschanel, Swizz Beatz, Selena Gomez, Spike Jonze, Joan Smalls, Lorde, NorthernSound and Rihanna.
For the Fall 2014 collection, Kenzo collaborated with filmmaker David Lynch, who mixed the soundtrack for the show and provided a large sculpture.
For the Fall and Winter 2016 collection, Kenzo produced the campaign film 'The Realest Real' starring Laura Harrier, Mahershala Ali, Natasha Lyonne, and Rowan Blanchard, and directed by Carrie Brownstein.
==Collaborations==
In 2016, Kenzo announced its collaboration with H&M. Kenzo X H&M collection was released on 3 November 2016. The fashion house also collaborates with Inglot Cosmetics company, which manufactures make-up products. On 21 March 2018 Kenzo revealed Britney Spears as the face of its new 'La Collection Memento No. 2' campaign.

Nanamori-zuka, tomb of Taira clan warriors
' is a Shinto shrine in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. It is dedicated to Antoku, a Japanese emperor who died as a child in the Battle of Dan-no-ura (aka Dannoura), which occurred nearby in 1185. This battle was important in the history of Japan because it brought an end to Genpei War in which the Minamoto clan defeated the rival Taira clan, and ended the Taira bid for control of Japan.
The shrine is situated on the waterfront of the Kanmon Strait, between the centre of Shimonoseki and the tourist restaurants of Karato, Kanmon Wharf. The bright red main gate makes it a very visible sight.
==Description==
The colours and style of the gate are inspired by Ryūgū-jō, according to the Shimonoseki Tourist Guidebook published by the Shimonoseki City Tourism Department. This source states that Antoku's grandmother, Nii-no-Ama, who drowned with Antoku, wished for their palace to be created underwater as she jumped into the sea. Ryūgū-jō is a mythical underwater palace, belonging to the dragon god of the sea. In the Tale of Heike, Nii-no-Ama told Antoku, before jumping, that they would go to an underwater palace, without referring to Ryūgū-jō. Then, Antoku's mother (Kenreimon-In, aka Taira no Tokuko) had a dream, in which they were living in Ryūgū-jō.
Inside, in the Hoichi Hall, is a statue of Hoichi the Earless, one of the characters in a traditional ghost story which was made known in the west by Lafcadio Hearn.
The grounds also contain the Nanamori-zuka (seven mounds), which represent the Heike warriors also lost in the Battle of Dan-no-Ura.
==Kanpei-sha==
In 1871, the  identified the hierarchy of government-supported shrines most closely associated with the Imperial family. The 'kampeisha' were shrines venerated by the imperial family. This category encompasses those sanctuaries enshrining emperors, imperial family members, or meritorious retainers of the Imperial family. Up through 1940, the mid-range of ranked Imperial shrines or  included the shrine; and it was then known as Akama'-gū' In 1940, Akama's status was changed , which is the highest rank; and since then, it has been known as Akama 'jingū.'

The class is sometimes referred to as the 'Tanikaze' class in some sources; however, 'Tanikaze' was launched and commissioned later than 'Kawakaze'.
==Background==
Construction of the new 'Kawakaze'-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 8-4 Fleet Program in fiscal 1915. A large destroyer with long range, capable of providing escort to the new battleship  and the two s were considered a part of this reduced spending naval program from the previous Eight-eight fleet project..
Although funding was authorized for only one destroyer, 'Tanikaze', the Italian government unexpectedly refunded Japan for its down payment of 870,000 Yen on the  , which had been transferred to the Royal Italian Navy before completion in England during World War I. These funds were used to complete a second vessel, which was also named 'Kawakaze'.
==Design==
Initially conceived of as a follow-on version of the earlier s, however, it was the first to use the new Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval guns that were to be used many subsequent classes of Japanese destroyers. In addition, given the experience with deployment of Japanese destroyers for extended periods overseas in World War I, the hull and bow needed to be reinforced to handle heavy seas. Furthermore, the navy wanted to add the latest technologies in terms of the new 533 mm torpedoes in three double launchers.
It was furthermore decided to use the same Brown-Curtis heavy fuel oil fired geared steam turbine engines as on the 'Tenryū'-class cruisers. The result was a ship was much more powerful that the earlier 'Isokaze' class, and capable of high speed operation.
==Operational history==
The 'Kawakaze'-class destroyers served during the interwar period. 'Kawakaze' was retired on 1 April 1934 and 'Tanikaze' a year later.

*'Denis Schneider' is a French painter born in Metz in 1946.
== Biography ==
Denis Schneider studied at the famous School of Beaux-Arts in Paris and started exhibiting in 1967 on the Parisian’s art market. In 1970, he took the decision to leave Paris to free himself from any restraints and dedicate himself to his art. Since then, he has been creating his works of art in seclusion.
Denis Schneider started exhibiting again in 1998. During that year, a Strasbourg gallery provided him an exclusive platform to display his paintings. As a result, his talent was discovered by Ineke Voorsteegh, former curator of the Department of Modern Art and Education in Dordrecht Museum and presently owner of the In-Vorm Gallery in Dordrecht –Netherlands. She offered him the opportunity to join her newly opened gallery to which belonged several other selected artists like Mark Brusse, Rein Dool, Hanskop Jansen, Peter Royen, Gerard Verdijk, Albert Verkade and others.
In 2001, Denis Schneider exhibited his paintings alongside Mark Brusse’s sculptures at the In-Vorm Gallery. He has since been exhibiting regularly in that gallery – on his own or with other artists.
In 2002 and 2003, Schneider exhibited his large scale paintings at the Gérard Philipe Theatre of St Denis. He was also responsible for illustrating the theatre’s various publications and playbills, including the one for Strindberg’s play "Sonate des spectres". He has been living in Ardèche since 1980 and has regularly exhibited in France and abroad.

==History==
Samuel Cobbs (who had represented nearby Amelia County in the House of Burgesses in 1747) in 1758 willed his  acre estate to his brothers Edmund and John. (John P. Cobbs and later John C. Cobbs would represent Nelson County in the Virginia House of Delegates, the latter possibly the son of Edmund Cobbs Jr. below). Edmund Cobbs in 1760 erected a house on the Bedford County property, and when he died in 1798, his widow received   acres and six sons shared about   acres. Tilghman Cobbs would first represent Bedford County in the state legislature in 1829 and again in 1839-1840.
Edmund Cobbs, Jr. had acquired about  acres on Cheese Creek, about 5 miles from his father's land, and began the current house in 1810, before acquiring the  dower land in an auction after his mother's death in 1814. He enlarged the house significantly between 1825 and 1830 to its present central-passage plan, but used the adjoining land as collateral. He died there in 1856, after selling off much of the land in pieces, several about 1830 and deeding 260 acres in 1843 to his son John C. Cobbs. His declining land and slave ownership may reflect declining soil fertility due to common practices in growing tobacco, as well as his personal moral values. In 1820, the year his daughter Lucy married her cousin Rev. Nicholas Hamner Cobbs, Edmund Cobbs owned 25 enslaved people (including 11 children); he owned 12 slaves in 1830, seven enslaved people in 1840 and nine (including four small children) in 1850. His son and heir John Cabell Cobbs would own 7 slaves (four of them children) in 1860. Rev. Nicholas Hamner Cobbs taught school at the New London Academy in Bedford County for several years as well as became an Episcopal priest in 1825 and received 38 acres from his father in law in 1828. He founded several Episcopal congregations in Bedford County and nearby areas before accepting a position in Petersburg, and then became bishop of Alabama in 1844. John C. Cobbs had owned $6,400 in real estate and $5,450 in personal property (including slaves) in 1860; in 1870, the real estate was valued at $1,820 and personal property at $769. His wife became insane when their children ranged in age from six to twenty years old; he would declare bankruptcy four years after the Panic of 1873 and resulting depression. However, the family did not lose the real estate until World War I, possibly because neighbors were in similarly difficult circumstances and fellow Episcopalian and lawyer Martin Parks Burks had set up a trust and was commissioner of accounts.
==Locust Hill==
The house was extensively renovated in 1932, after its purchase by John Capron, a colonial history enthusiast who renamed it "Locust Hill". The renovations reflected his preferred "Williamsburg style", now considered more formal than authentic for the Piedmont locale. He mentioned it as "from an earlier era" in a book he published for the Lynchburg sesquicentennial in 1936. A garage, barn, guest house, and tenant house were also erected during the Capron era.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

*  Box Score - ESPN'Neide Núria de Sousa Van-Dúnem Vieira' (born July 4, 1986), also known as 'Neide', is a popular Angolan contemporary singer, songwriter, and film/television actress. Born and raised in 
Luanda, Angola, Neide started her acting career in local theater in 2003, at the age of 17, being cast in the television soap "Sede de Viver" a year later. Her singing career officially began in 2007 with the release of the hit single "Olá Baby" in the compilation album 'Eu e Elas (vol 1)', a song for which the video reached the number two spot on the MTV Africa Video Chart.
== Early life ==
Neide was born on July 4, 1986, in Luanda, Angola and is the only child of José António Vieira and Isabel Maria de Fátima Sousa Van-Dúnem, although she has three half-brothers and six half-sisters. Neide's interest in music came at a very early age although it was as an actress at age 17 that she would have her first encounter with fame. But she eventually broke into the music scene in 2007 with the release of the hit single "Olá Baby".
== Recording career ==
=== 2006–2007: 'Olá Baby' ===
In collaboration with producer Caló Pascoal, Neide's initial venture into the music business came in the form of a duet with the producer on the song "Olá Baby", the lead single of the compilation album 'Eu e Elas (vol 1)' released on April 29, 2007. The song's commercial success launched Neide's singing career and established her as a "double threat" in the entertainment business (singing and acting).
===2008–2009: 'Teu Marido Casou/Esta Noite'===
Neide decided to put her acting career on hold to venture forth as an independent artist and started working on her debut solo album, writing all of its tracks. The music styles she employed were primarily Kizomba and Semba but the influence of R&B is strong. "Teu Marido Casou (com outra)" was the first song to get radio play, to be later released as a CD single along with the song "Esta Noite". The full album was scheduled to be released in the second half of 2009 but its release was postponed.

==Introduction==
SOAPjr is designed to create clean, fast, Ajax-style APIs and is analogous to the introduction of out of band signalling in the telephony world.
Traditional SOAP is no longer the Simple Object Access Protocol it was initially designed to be. It can be bloated and overly verbose, making it bandwidth-hungry and slow. It is also based on XML, making it expensive to parse and manipulate  - especially on mobile or embedded clients. However, its core envelope/head/body design pattern is useful for Ajax style APIs.
SOAPjr uses a similar Envelope/Head/Body model, using lightweight and easier to manipulate JSON.
In contrast to SOAP, JSON-RPC is overly simplistic and basically tunnels HTTP GET-style key/value pairs within a query string using JSON. However, within JSON-RPC there is no head/body separation, leaving metadata to pollute the main data space.
SOAPjr combines the best of these two concepts and is designed to create modern Ajax APIs that can easily be used by mobile devices, embedded systems or desktop browsers.
See  SOAPjr Specs for a more detailed description.
 SOAPjr is an Open Source project with software released under the GPL and content under Creative Commons.
==JSON-Schema definitions==
The following SOAPjr entities are defined as  JSON-Schemas.
*  SOAPjr_basic_object
*  SOAPjr_error_record
*  SOAPjr_errors_object
*  SOAPjr_request
*  SOAPjr_response
The latest versions can also be downloaded in a  single file.
==Common data models==
SOAPjr.org also aims to contribute to the creation of a common set of DMDs (Data Model Definitions) that may align with the JSON-schema proposal and Service Mapping Description Proposal so applications within specific domains can easily share data. The primary extension that SOAPjr may provide here is the use of consistent or standardised error codes.
Other resources that may inform this development are common data models utilised within microformats and RDF
==Examples==
This is a basic request to view the jCard details for a single user (based on their username). This message would be passed in a request within the "json" parameter e.g.
?json={"HEAD":{"service_type":"contacts","action_type":"view",
"sid":"80e5b8a8b9cbf3a79fe8d624628a0fe5"},"BODY":{"username":"jbloggs"}}
{
    "HEAD" : {
        "service_type" : "contacts",
        "action_type" : "view",
        "sid" : "80e5b8a8b9cbf3a79fe8d624628a0fe5"
    },
    "BODY" : {
        "username" : "jbloggs"
    }
}
This is a simple SOAPjr response with a HEAD.result that represents a success. The BODY contains a single jCard record. In a list "list" or "search" context this would contain an array of 0 or more jCard records.
{
    "HEAD" : {
        "result" : "1"
    },
    "BODY" : {
        "email" : 
            {
                "type" : "internet","pref",
                "value" : "spam@SOAPjr.org"
            }
        ,
        "fn" : "Joe Bloggs",
        "kind" : "individual",
        "n" : {
            "family-name" : "Bloggs",
            "given-name" : "Joe",
            "value" : "Bloggs;Joe"
        },

(The first two lines are: 'Who’s the leader of the Club that’s made for you and me? M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!') The song is reprised with the slower "it's time to say goodbye" verse, at the end of each episode. In the show's opening, the song is partially performed by the characters Dumbo and Jiminy Cricket. It also ended with Donald Duck attempting to hit a gong with the "Mickey Mouse Club" title on it, but would end with comic results, such as him getting hit by lightning, or the gong turning out to be a pie, or Donald just hitting a triangle instead.
The song was written by the 'Mickey Mouse Club' host Jimmie Dodd and was published by Hal Leonard Corporation, July 1, 1955. Dodd, who was a guitarist and musician hired by Walt Disney as a songwriter, wrote other songs used over the course of the series, as well, such as the “theme day” songs sung on the show.
==Cover versions==
Julie London covered the song on her 1967 album, 'Nice Girls Don't Stay for Breakfast'. Mannheim Steamroller covered the song as the final track on the album, 'Mannheim Steamroller Meets the Mouse' (1999). In 2000, a eurobeat version of the song was released on the Japan-only 'Eurobeat Disney', recorded by Domino and Dave Rodgers. Andrew W.K. also covered the song, on the Japanese-only release of the album 'Mosh Pit On Disney' (2004).
In 2017, D-Metal Stars created a Heavy Metal cover of the song on the album "Metal Disney" featuring Mike Vescera and Rudy Sarzo
There was a gachimuchi cover made of Mickey Mouse March called "Bockey Mouse March" on YouTube, receiving immense amount of popularity until it was removed by YouTube.
==In popular culture==
* In 'M*A*S*H' season 5 (1976–77), Hawkeye Pierce sings the M-O-U-S-E line of the song after Radar O'Reilly spells out a name. The episode was first aired in December 1976, but depicts events in 1952, three years before the song was published.
* In Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam War film 'Full Metal Jacket' (1987), American Marines sing the song to ironic effect at the film's end, as they march out of the city at the Battle of Huế.
==Parodies==
* The titles for the second series of Alexei Sayle's BBC comedy series, 'Alexei Sayle's Stuff' are a parody of those for 'The Mickey Mouse Club' with the third and fourth lines: 'Who’s an ugly bastard and as fat as he can be? A-L-E-X-E-I S-A-Y-L-E!'

== Ohio public library funding ==
The first financial support of public libraries in Ohio began in 1933 when libraries received revenue from the intangible personal property tax. The intangibles tax was levied on individuals’ holdings of stock and bonds. The revenue was collected in the county of origin and was distributed to libraries based on need.
In 1983, the Ohio General Assembly repealed the intangibles tax and replaced it with the Library and Local Government Support Fund or LLGSF. An amount of the personal income tax equaling 6.3% of Ohio’s personal income tax receipts were earmarked for the LLGSF. This funding was divided using an equalization formula so that underserved areas would receive a guaranteed share.
In 1993, the General Assembly passed legislation reducing the LLGSF from 6.3% to 5.7% of personal income tax. It remained at that level until the 2002-2003 biennium budget called for the funding to be frozen at the same level as July 2000 through June 2001. This was the beginning of a funding freeze which lasted through December 2007.
Beginning with January 2008 distributions, a new funding source was developed. This fund named the Public Library Fund or PLF is 2.22% of the state’s total general tax revenue.

*The '2000 United States elections' were held on November 7, 2000. Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas defeated Democratic Vice President Al Gore of Tennessee in the presidential election. Republicans retained control of both houses of Congress, giving the party unified control of Congress and the presidency for the first time since the 1954 elections.
With Democratic President Bill Clinton term-limited, Gore won his party's nomination by defeating Senator Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries. Bush defeated Senator John McCain in the Republican primaries to win his party's presidential nomination. Bush took 271 of the 538 electoral votes, winning the decisive state of Florida by a margin of 537 votes after a recount was halted by the Supreme Court in the case of 'Bush v. Gore'. Bush was the first winning presidential candidate to lose the popular vote since the 1888 presidential election.

It was founded in 1970 when Wilber High School and Clatonia High School consolidated, forming the Wilber Clatonia Public School District, which has 530 students (K-12). The high school enrollment is approximately 258 students (grades 7-12).
The Wilber Clatonia Public School District is a consolidated system located in Saline and Gage Counties and covers an area of . It has an assessed valuation of $225,842,971 and provides education to 530 students in kindergarten through grade 12. A $6,125,000 bond passage passed in August 2003 provided for the construction of a Pre-kindergarten to 6th-grade classroom facility with a library, computer lab, and gymnasium. The bond issue also provided for a new running track.
==History==
The first class graduated from Wilber High School in 1886. A new high school building was built around 1910. In 1930 a new high school building was built to the east of the old building, and the old high school was used for elementary classes. When the new school district was formed in 1970, a new high school building was built on South Franklin Street. The older school building to the west was torn down and became a playground area. The 1930 high school then became the elementary school, providing facilities for the students in the city and students now attending in town because many of the rural school districts were closed as part of the consolidation. In 2005 the elementary school was added to the existing high school and the 1930 building was torn down.
==Athletics==
The school's rival in sports is Tri-County. The school colors are green and white, and the mascot is the wolverine.
Wilber Clatonia won the Class C State Championship in girls' basketball in 1983, finishing 27-0 in the season. The 1997-98 wrestling team finished the dual season comprising a record of 6-0-1, the lone tie coming to Lincoln Christian.  The Wilber girls' basketball team almost beat the consecutive losing record. In the 2016-17 season, they also won the class C2 football championship.

== Controversy ==
The creators of bigFM had always been using practices that were rated by observers as nonsense or meaningless. In one case in 2016 this also led to a criticism of the national institute for communication Baden-Wuerttemberg at the marketing practice of the transmitter.
One of the station's most controversial actions took place in summer 2017. Breakfast DJ Rob Green attempted to send a WhatsApp message to Marlen Gröger, who he expected to be a newsreader for DASDING. Its content stated that if she could leave the studio immediately even when she was reading out the news on that station, she would get a job on "Germany's biggest morning show". That message was finally sent at 7:31am that day.
The message was as follows (originally in German):'Hey Marlen, wenn du jetzt LIVE während deiner Nachrichten hinschmeißt, hab ich nen Job für dich in Deutschlands biggster Morningshow auf BigFM! Wir hören dich gerade!'It turned out that the person who read the newscast at the time on DASDING was Athene Pi Permantier, not Marlen. In addition, Marlen had already finished her contract with DASDING for quite some time and was now working at BigFM.
The radio station's production team posted an image of the act as its proof, however it caused some major backlash, with Facebook users calling the act "fake news", "scam" and questioning the station's journalistic ethic. Moreover, Baden-Württemberg Foundation decided to cancel the media partnership with BigFM for an event against fake news, false reports and fake information. The radio station later issued an apology saying they were sorry for this cancellation, but assured it was completely about "introducing a new good journalist" alone, and argued that the term of "fake news" was highly questionable, since Rob Green's show was entertainment-oriented, not hard news-oriented. In the comment section under some of the event's reports, some users said the action was not good, but described the excitement as "exaggerated." It was also noted that Marlen Gröger could not read Rob's message whatsoever during the live newscast. After investigating this view was confirmed by the Landesanstalt für Kommunikation Baden-Württemberg (LFK). There is also no violation of the state media law. The LFK accused the media criticism website Übermedien.de for "mistakenly" reporting about the bigFM action.

==Design and Construction==
Built in Dundee by Stephens & Sons as the whaler 'Bloodhound' in 1873, she was ideally suited to Arctic exploration.  She was purchased by the Admiralty on 5 December 1874 and converted for exploration, commissioning on 13 April 1875. She carried a barque-rig and her Greenock Foundry Company steam engine generated an indicated 312 horsepower.
==Career==
===British Arctic Expedition===
Captain George Strong Nares was placed in command of the 1875 British Arctic Expedition, which aimed to reach the North Pole via Smith Sound, the sea passage between Greenland and Canada's northernmost island, Ellesmere Island. Contemporary geographers proposed that there could be an Open Polar Sea, and that if the thick layer of ice surrounding it were overcome, access to the North Pole by sea might be possible. Ever since Edward Augustus Inglefield had penetrated Smith Sound in 1852, it had been a likely route to the North. Nares commanded the converted sloop HMS 'Alert', and with him went 'Discovery', commanded by Captain Henry Frederick Stephenson. HMS 'Valorous' carried extra stores and accompanied the expedition as far as Godhavn.
Despite finding heavier-than-expected ice, the expedition pressed on. Leaving 'Discovery' to winter at Lady Franklin Bay, 'Alert' carried on a further  through the Robeson Channel, establishing her winter quarters at Floeberg Beach. Spring 1876 saw considerable activity by sledge charting the coasts of Ellesmere Island and Greenland, but scurvy had begun to take hold, with 'Alert' suffering the greatest burden. On 3 April, the second-in-command of 'Alert', Albert Hastings Markham, took a party north to attempt the Pole. By 11 May, having made slow progress, they reached their greatest latitude at 83° 20' 26"N.  Suffering from snow blindness, scurvy and exhaustion, they turned back.  
   
The expedition returned to the UK in Autumn 1876 and was well rewarded; Nares was knighted, Markham was promoted to Captain. The geography of northern Canada and Greenland is littered with the names of those connected with the expedition; Cape Discovery () on the northern edge of Ellesmere Island is named for the ship.
===Storeship at Portsmouth===
The 'Discovery' saw no further seagoing service after her return from the Arctic. She was employed as a storeship in Portsmouth Harbour from 1880, probably up until the time of her final disposal.
==Disposal==
'Discovery' was sold to D Murray in February 1902.
==Legacy==
RRS 'Discovery' open to the public in Dundee.
The 1901 research vessel, built for the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901–1904), incorporated many of the features of 'Discovery', as well as taking her name. RRS 'Discovery' was commanded by Robert Falcon Scott and took part in the Discovery Investigations from 1924 to 1931. She is now on permanent display at Dundee.
Subsequent Royal Research Ships, launched in 1929 and 1962, have also borne the name, as has Space Shuttle 'Discovery'.

==Coaching career==
Vukoičić was 19 years old in 1994 when he began working as coach in KK FMP's youth system. He continued there until 2003 when he got promoted to the position of first team assistant coach. He worked under head coaches Aco Petrović, Vlade Đurović, and Boško Đokić.
===FMP Železnik===
Vukoičić's first head coaching appointment came in 2005 at FMP where he ended up spending two and a half seasons. He won the 2005–06 Adriatic League title with the club. Next year he led the team to the semifinals of the 2006–07 ULEB Cup and also won the Serbian Cup. He left the position on January 14, 2008.
===Hemofarm and Oostende in 2018===
On March 20, 2008 KK Hemofarm brought Vukoičić in to replace Miroslav Nikolić. Vukoičić finished out the 2007–08 season at the club before moving on. In the summer of 2008, he was hired by Belgian team BC Oostende, but left in October.
===Bosna===
In early November 2008, Vukoičić agreed on terms with KK Bosna, six days after the team's previous head coach Alen Abaz resigned in late October following a loss at KK Budućnost Podgorica in the Adriatic League. Goran Šehovac assumed temporary charge for one game before Vukoičić took over with his Bosna debut taking place in Belgrade away at KK Crvena zvezda.
Vukoičić led the Sarajevo team to the 7th place Adriatic League finish with an 11–15 overall win-loss season record. Under Vukoičić's command, KK Bosna had a 9–11 record. On 12 April 2009, following a Bosnia-Herzegovina league loss away at Borac Banja Luka, Vukoičić offered his resignation. It was not accepted, and he continued on as head coach. In late May 2009, during the Bosnian domestic league finals series, he signed a 4-year contract extension with the club. KK Bosna ended up losing the final series versus HKK Široki 0–2.
Vukoičić started the 2009–10 season as head coach but was fired in early December 2009 following a 1–9 start in the Adriatic League, including a 50-point loss to KK Zadar.
===Mega Vizura===
In 2010, Vukoičić became head coach of KK Mega Vizura from Belgrade, in the Basketball League of Serbia. In his first season with the club, Mega Vizura finished the season's initial stage in 4th spot with 15-11 record thus qualifying for the final stage (Superliga) of the competition. That year, Mega Vizura finished in last place with 3-11 record.
===Crvena zvezda===
On October 4, 2012, he became head coach of the Serbian team Crvena zvezda, replacing recently fired Milivoje Lazić. Arriving to Crvena zvezda for Vukoičić meant getting reunited with Nebojša Čović whom he worked for over a decade in various capacities at FMP Železnik.
On 15 April, days after a loss to Mega Vizura, Vukoičić's firing was announced while Dejan Radonjić who coached Adriatic League rivals KK Budućnost got named as replacement with club president Čović citing "obvious deterioration of form" as the reason for the change.
===MZT Skopje===
On June 24, 2013, he became head coach of the Macedonian basketball champion MZT Skopje. In December 2013 he resigned and was replaced with Zoran Martič.
==National team coaching==
===Serbia youth teams===
In 2007, Basketball Federation of Serbia (KSS) named Vukoičić (at the time coaching FMP Železnik at club level) head coach of the Serbian under-20 national team for the upcoming European under-20 Championship in Slovenia and Italy.
Despite losing their opening game versus co-hosts Slovenia, Vukoičić's team quickly got on track, winning all their games until the end, including the final versus Spain and defending the title.
Four years later in 2011, Vukoičić, now coaching Mega Vizura at club level, was asked to coach the Serbian under-18 team at the Euro championships in Poland.
===Serbia full squad assistant coach===
In late summer 2012, ahead of the EuroBasket 2013 qualifying matches, Vukoičić joined the national team's coaching setup as one of the three assistants to Serbia national team's head coach Dušan Ivković. Serbia managed to qualify despite losing 5 matches including to the Minnows, Estonia.

*  Profile on eurobasket.comThe 'goldenstriped soapfish' ('Grammistes sexlineatus'), also known as the 'lined soapfish', 'golden-striped bass', 'radio fish', 'sixline soapfish', 'six-lined perch' or 'white-lined rock cod', is a species of marine ray-finned fish, related to the groupers and classified within the subfamily Epinephelinae of the family Serranidae. It is has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution.
==Description==
'Grammistes sexlineatus' is a middle sized fish, which can grow to a maximum length of 30 cm. Its background body color is dark brown with a maximum of six white to yellow horizontal lines.  The number of lines depends on the maturity of the fish.  Juveniles have white to yellow dots on a dark background until an approximate size of 17.5 mm. Thereafter, the points gradually become lines.  At a length of 5 cm, these soap fish have three horizontal lines. Only from 8 cm long that the soapfish gets the six distinctive horizontal lines. Note that in adult specimens close to the maximum size, these lines tend to sever to form small strokes and points.
==Distribution and habitat==
The six lined soapfish is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific area from the eastern coast of Africa to the oceanic islands of the Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii and the Red Sea. And from south Japan to north New Zealand.
This soapfish occurs in coastal rocky and coral reefs from shallow to 40–50 meters depth.
==Biology==
Individuals are generally solitary in their reef habitat. They usually stay hidden in crevices, and are most active at night.
Like other fish in the subfamily Grammistinae, this species produces a toxin from the skin. The toxins in the skin secretions are known as grammistins. These secretions resemble lathered soap and are the basis for the common name of Soap Fish. This is not caught as a food fish because the flesh reportedly has a bitter, unpleasant taste.
==Taxonomy==
The goldenstriped soapfish was first formally described as 'Perca sixlineata' in 1792 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg (1743-1828) with the type locality given as the Eat Indes or Japan.

*'Avisauridae' is a family of extinct enantiornithine birds from the Cretaceous period, distinguished by several features of their ankle bones. Depending on the definition used, Avisauridae is either a broad and widespread group of advanced enantiornithines (following Cau & Arduini, 2008), or a small family within that group, restricted to species from the Late Cretaceous of North and South America (following Chiappe, 1992).
== Description ==
Avisaurids were among the largest and last enantiornithines to have lived, although they are also among the most poorly preserved. The majority of them are known primarily from fossilized tarsometatarsal bones, the part of a bird's leg formed by fused metatarsals (the bones which comprise the foot in humans). As a result, members of this family are distinguished from other enantiornithines exclusively by features of the tarsometatarsal and pedal phalanges (toe bones).
Unlike in some prehistoric birds, avisaurid tarsometatarsals were not completely fused, with the distal (outer) parts of the metatarsals being separate from each other. The proximal (near) half of metatarsal III (the long bone in the middle of the tarsometatarsus) is convex from the front. The inside edge of this bone's trochlea (toe joint) has a bony tab which points downward, known as a plantar projection. The innermost bone of the tarsometatarsus, metatarsal I, is small, laterally compressed (flattened from side-to-side), and J-shaped from the side. It is connected to a reversed hallux sporting a very large and curved claw.
Chiappe and Calvo (1994) found that the Avisauridae shared adaptations of the foot — including a fully reversed and distally placed hallux with a large claw — that indicated the ability to perch in trees. They argued that an arboreal habit was most likely for all of the Avisauridae.
== History and classification ==
Avisauridae was erected as a family by Brett-Surman and Paul in 1985. At that time the family consisted of a few fossils that they believed belonged to small non-avian dinosaurs. They doubted that these fossils belonged to birds due to the presence of several features of the tarsometatarsus. In 'Avisaurus' (the only avisaurid known at that time), only the proximal parts of the metatarsals were fused, the proximal part of metatarsal III was wide, and the hypotarsus (a wide ridge extending down the back of the tarsometatarsus) was poorly developed.
However, Chiappe later reassigned the Avisauridae to the class Aves (which is equivalent to the clade Avialae in modern usage) and the subclass Enantiornithes in 1992. He noted that the features used to exclude avisaurids from birds are in fact present in some early birds such as 'Archaeopteryx', as well as various Cretaceous bird groups. Avisaurids also had a thin metatarsal IV (the outermost long bone of the tarsometatarsus) and a bony knob on the front of metatarsal II (the most innermost long bone of the tarsometatarsus) for the insertion of 'M. tibialis cranialis' (the muscle which flexes the ankle, also known as the 'M. tibialis anticus' or 'M. tibialis anterior'), both believed to be enantiornithean features.
Chiappe defined the family as the common ancestor of 'Neuquenornis volans' and 'Avisaurus archibaldi' plus all its descendants. In 2008, the family was given a broader definition courtesy of Cau and Arduini. They redefined the group as 'Avisaurus archibaldi' and all genera more closely related to it than to either 'Longipteryx', 'Gobipteryx' or 'Sinornis'. Matt Martyniuk gave the name 'Avisauroidea' to this group, although the erection of that name has been criticized by Cau. Under this broader definition, several other enantiornitheans, such as 'Enantiophoenix', would qualify as members of the family. Nevertheless, enantiornithean taxonomy is notably difficult to resolve, and some analyses on enantiornitheans have not resolved the family. However, this may be due to such analyses focusing on early Cretaceous enantiornitheans (which are numerous and well-preserved) rather than fragmentary late Cretaceous taxa, such as most avisaurids.
The following is a cladogram based on Cau and Arduini (2008):
==References=='John Collins Dawson IV' (June 16, 1945 – July 21, 2009), nicknamed "'Marmaduke'", was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He was best known as the leader and co-founder of the country rock band the New Riders of the Purple Sage. He sang lead vocals on most of the band’s songs.
==Musical career==
John Dawson was born in Chicago. His family moved to California in 1952. The son of a Los Altos Hills, California filmmaker, he took guitar lessons from a teacher and friend from the Peninsula School in Menlo Park, California. For high school he attended the Millbrook School near Millbrook, New York. While at Millbrook, he took courses in music theory & history and sang in the glee club.
Dawson's musical career began in the mid-1960s folk music scene in the San Francisco Bay Area. There he met fellow guitarist David Nelson, and was part of the rotating lineup of Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, a jug band that included Jerry Garcia and several other future members of the Grateful Dead.  Dawson was also heavily influenced by the Bakersfield sound genre of country music.
After a stint at Occidental College, Dawson remained in the Los Angeles metropolitan area for several years. By 1969, Dawson had returned to Los Altos Hills to attend courses at Foothill College. Along with Nelson, he also contributed to the sessions for 'Aoxomoxoa', the Grateful Dead's third studio album. He also began to write a number of country rock songs, a development coinciding with Garcia's newfound interest in playing pedal steel guitar. Joined by Nelson, they formed the New Riders of the Purple Sage. The New Riders became the opening act for the Grateful Dead, and their original lineup included three Grateful Dead members — Garcia on pedal steel, Phil Lesh on bass, and Mickey Hart on drums. Within a year, Dave Torbert replaced Lesh and Spencer Dryden replaced Hart in the New Riders lineup, with Garcia continuing to play in both bands. In 1970 and 1971, the New Riders and the Grateful Dead performed many concerts together. In November 1971, Buddy Cage replaced Jerry Garcia as the New Riders' pedal steel player, allowing NRPS to tour independently of the Dead.
During this same period, Dawson continued to appear as a guest musician on Grateful Dead studio albums, including 'Workingman's Dead' (1970) and 'American Beauty' (1970).  With Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter, he co-wrote the song "Friend of the Devil".
In the years that followed, Dawson and Nelson led a gradually evolving lineup of musicians in the New Riders of the Purple Sage, playing their psychedelic influenced brand of country rock and releasing a number of studio and live albums. Songwriting duties were generally divided between Dawson (who grew gradually less prolific before enjoying a resurgence on the band's final studio album) and a succession of three bassists: Torbert, Skip Battin (best known for his work with the Clarence White-era Byrds) and Roger McGuinn Band veteran Stephen A. Love. In 1982, David Nelson and Buddy Cage left the band. John Dawson and the New Riders carried on without them, taking on more of a bluegrass influence with the addition of multi-instrumentalist Rusty Gauthier to the group. NRPS continued to tour intermittently and released the occasional album.  Then, in 1997, Dawson retired from the music business, moved to Mexico, and became an English teacher, and the New Riders disbanded.
In 2005, David Nelson and Buddy Cage revived the New Riders of the Purple Sage, without Dawson's participation but with his agreement and moral support. Subsequently Dawson made several guest appearances at New Riders concerts.
Dawson died in Mexico of stomach cancer on July 21, 2009.

==References=='General elections' were held in Saint Kitts and Nevis on 25 January 2010 for eleven of the fourteen or fifteen seats in the National Assembly. The other three or four members of the National Assembly will be appointed by the Governor-General after the elections.
The ruling Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP), led by Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, won a fourth term in office. It was opposed in the campaign by the opposition People's Action Movement (PAM), led by Lindsay Grant. Both parties received much of their support from the island of Saint Kitts, which chooses eight of the eleven elected members of the National Assembly.
On the neighboring island of Nevis, local parties, including the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) and the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM), vied for three seats in the National Assembly. Support from Nevisian political parties could decide control of the national government in a tight election.
The continuing economic crisis was a major issue in the campaign. The national debt of Saint Kitts and Nevis had risen to US$2 billion under the SKNLP government, roughly $50,000 per citizen. Prime Minister Denzil Douglas shrugged off accusations that he had let the debt spiral upward during his fifteen years in office: 
:"It is important for me to state that St. Kitts and Nevis has never missed any payments on the national debt under Labour. This is very important. Many countries owe less, but are repeatedly unable to service their debt."
==Background==
Before the 2010 election, the Labour Party controlled seven of the eight seats allocated to the island of Saint Kitts in the Assembly. The opposition People's Action Movement (PAM) controlled the other Saint Kitts seat. From nearby Nevis, the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM) controlled two of Nevis' three seats in the Assembly, while the opposition Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) controlled the other seat.
Prime Minister Douglas, speaking to a crowd of approximately 15,000 in Basseterre on 9 January 2010, announced the dates for the upcoming election. He set Nomination Day for 15 January 2010, with the general election to be held on 25 January.
==Conduct==
Armed police had to respond to protests alleging voting irregularities in the constituency where the PAM leader Lindsay Grant was up against Glen "Ghost" Phillips of the SKNLP. PAM supporters contended that "outsiders" were being brought into the Half Way Tree Community Centre, seven miles (11 km) from the capital Basseterre, to vote. Elsewhere in the country, voting was reported to be calm "amidst overcast skies following some intermittent morning showers."
==Results==
On Saint Kitts, the SKNLP won six out of the eight seats. The PAM gained a new National Assembly member, Eugene Hamilton, while PAM deputy leader Shawn Richards retained his seat. Prime Minister Denzil Douglas retained his seat for Constituency Six by a margin of 1905 votes to 179.
On Nevis, the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM) won two seats, with the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) taking the third.
== References =='Hibriten High School' ('HHS') is a comprehensive, four-year high school accredited by the NC Department of Public Instruction and the Southern Colleges and Schools. The school is nestled at the foot of Hibriten Mountain, located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Lenoir, North Carolina.
==History==
=== Hibriten Academy ===
The Hibriten Academy was founded in 1885 on the Wildwood Road.  It was a larger school than most of the ones for that period of time as it had three teachers and students of all ages.  The rooms were heated with pot-bellied stoves, and the boy students had to cut the wood to keep the fires going.  Water was carried to the rooms in a bucket and the students had their own cup to pour the water into from the bucket. Hibriten Academy was consolidated with Kings Creek High at the end of the 1932 school term.
=== Building and construction of Hibriten High School ===
Following a survey of the schools of Caldwell County in 1963, the State Department of Public Instruction recommended that three of the rural schools—Oak Hill, King's Creek, and Happy Valley—be consolidated.  It was also recommended that a new building be constructed on a new site for the consolidated high school.  Thirty-five acres of land, located in the Lower Creek section of the county, were purchased at a cost of $37,500.
In 1962, an architect was employed for a period of two years to complete plans for the building.  Designed in a plan similar to a split-level building, the school consists of three levels and contains departments in science, home economics, English, French, math, social studies, music, physical education, drama, child care center, and vocational studies which include technical drafting, business, introduction to vocations, agriculture, carpentry, graphics, electronics, bricklaying, and the work study programs of industrial cooperative training and distributive education.  The building also includes administrative offices for the principal, assistant principal, secretary, guidance suite, visual air room, two first-aid rooms, and a conference room.  The cafeteria seats 250 people.
Located at the foot of the Hibriten Mountain, the school was given the name of Hibriten High School.  Its mascot is a panther, and the school colors are red, black, and white.  It is located two miles from the main thoroughfare of the city of Lenoir.  The school was officially opened in the fall of 1966 with Kenneth A. Roberts as principal and Ronald Beane as assistant principal.  Student enrollment for the 1966-67 school term was 715, with a faculty of 42.  The class of 1967 graduated 118 students. Five elementary schools send students to Hibriten High School.
The gymnasium and music building were completed in 1972 with the gym seating 1800 people.
==School bands==
The Hibriten High School Symphonic Band is the main band of the school. It was established in 1966. As of Spring 2017, the bands (both symphonic and concert bands) have accumulated fifty-three superior ratings (21 consecutive by the symphonic band from 1994 to 2014), with most of them in Grade VI music (the most difficult level).
Of note are the band directors who taught at Hibriten and who are now in the North Carolina Bandmaster's Hall of Fame. These include George Kirsten (George Kirsten's sister Dorothy Kirsten sang operatic mezzo-soprano in the NY Metropolitan Opera), and Camilla Graeber. Other HHS Band directors have been honored by the Northwest District of the NC Bandmasters Association including Dennis Carswell, John Craig, and Bill Witcher.
==School songs==
The fight song was written by Captain Ralph Ostrom. The alma mater was written by Kathryn Wilson and John Craig.
==Notable alumni==
* Nick Easton, NFL offensive lineman
* Bobby McMillon, singer, musician, and storyteller
== References =='HVAC Testing, Adjusting and Balancing' ('TAB') are the three major steps used to achieve proper operation of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. TAB usually refers to commercial building construction and the specialized contractors who employ personnel that perform this service.
In general, the TAB specialist performs air and hydronic measurements on the HVAC systems and adjusts the flows as required to achieve optimum performance of the building environmental equipment. The balancing is usually based upon the design flow values required by the Mechanical Engineer for the project, and the TAB contractor submits a written report which summarizes the testing and balancing and notes any deficiencies found during the TAB work. Many times facility managers will use a TAB contractor to assist in identifying preexisting or common issues with a facility. While not necessary to be a TAB contractor, many contractors tend to hold professional air balancing certifications.
==Testing==
Testing is the use of specialized and calibrated instruments to measure temperatures, pressures, rotational speeds, electrical characteristics, velocities, and air and water quantities for an evaluation of equipment and system performance.
==Adjusting==
Adjusting is the final setting of balancing devices such as dampers and valves, adjusting fan speeds and pump impeller sizes, in addition to automatic control devices such as thermostats and pressure controllers to achieve maximum specified system performance and efficiency during normal operation.
==Balancing==
Balancing is the methodical regulation of system fluid flows (air or water) through the use of acceptable procedures to achieve the desired or specified design airflow or water flow. When beginning the balance of a system, you must locate the terminal with the least amount of flow in regards to the engineer's drawing. Once the "low" terminal has been located, you can then proceed to adjust all other diffusers/grilles (air) or circuit balancing valves (water) to proportionally match the original "low" terminal. There must be at least one terminal that is wide open to achieve optimum efficiency.
== Notes =='John Robert Murff' (April 1, 1921 – November 28, 2008) was a relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from  through  for the Milwaukee Braves. Listed at , 195 lb., Murff batted and threw right-handed. He attended Gettysburg College.
A native of Burlington, Texas, Murff started his professional baseball career in A and AA ball. On June 8, 1951, while pitching for the Texas City Texans, he threw a no-hitter against the Harlingen Capitals. A year later, he pitched  innings of a 20-inning game, in a lost cause against the Texarkana Bears, who defeated the Texans, 3–2. Then, in 1955, he won 'The Sporting News' Minor League Player of the Year Award and was named Texas League Pitcher of the Year after going 27–11 for the Dallas Eagles.
Murff entered the majors in 1956 with the Braves as a 35-year-old rookie, having been signed by Milwaukee scout Earle W. Halstead. In a story chronicled in Murff's biography "The Scout", Halstead negotiated with Dick Burnett, owner of the Dallas Eagles in the Texas League, where Murff played. The two sides reached an impasse until Halstead proposed a game of gin rummy with the winner setting the terms of the trade. Halstead won and the Braves paid Burnett $40,000 and three players from the 40 man roster to obtain Murff's contract. In part of two seasons, he posted a 2–2 record with a 4.65 ERA and three saves in 26 appearances, including two starts, giving up 26 earned runs on 56 hits and 18 walks while striking out 31 in  innings of work.
Following his majors career, Murff coached in the minors and managed the 1960 Jacksonville Braves of the South Atlantic League. As a scout for the New York Mets, he discovered and signed future Hall of Famer pitcher Nolan Ryan and All-Star catcher Jerry Grote. Ryan, later named president of the Texas Rangers, noted his friendship with Murff in his 1999 Hall of Fame induction speech.
In the early 1970s, Murff helped start the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor baseball program, and retired to Tyler, Texas in 1991 after serving 34 years as a scout. He was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Texas Scouts Association Hall of Fame in 1999, and in 1994 the UMHB's ballpark was named in his honour, Red Murff Field.
Murff died in a Tyler nursing home at the age of 87.

At the company's AGM in November 2013 it was decided to change the company's name from Kedco PLC to REACT Energy PLC to reflect the company's changed business focus.  The share price of the company has remained volatile since renaming and trading in the company's shares was briefly suspended in December 2014 amid concerns about the future viability of the company. 
In 2016, Farmer Business Development plc invested in REACT to keep the project afloat. 
=== EQTEC ===
In February 2017, the company was once again renamed, this time to EQTEC PLC. 
== Kedco ==
Kedco operated 2 distinct divisions targeting both Residential and Industrial client bases.
The Power division specialises in power generation from sustainable fuel sources with Kedco providing bio-science solutions to industrial clients by converting waste into an energy resource.
The Energy division supplied renewable energy heating products within Ireland, primarily to residential customers. Kedco registered with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland as 'Wood Pellet Ireland'. 
Both divisions remained in operation for a period of time, however the company stated in a press release in late 2008 that "Kedco Power constitutes the main part of the company going forward". The company subsequently decided to cease supplying products to the domestic market and since 2012 it has focused exclusively on industrial energy solutions.

==References=='Mountaineer Militia' was a local anti-government paramilitary group, members of which plotted to blow up an FBI building Clarksburg, West Virginia in 1996. The group also used the name West Virginia Mountaineer Militia, and had ties with another militias from other states.
==Plot and arrest==
On October 11, 1996, seven men having connections with the Mountaineer Militia, a local anti-government paramilitary group, were arrested on charges of plotting to blow up the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Criminal Justice Information Services Division in Clarksburg, West Virginia, after a 16-month investigation. The group had even considered the killing United States Senator Jay Rockefeller and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in a "holy war" against the "tiranous" U.S. government.
While members of the group had been assembling large quantities of explosives and blasting caps, militia leader Floyd Raymond Looker obtained blueprints of the FBI facility from a Clarksburg, West Virginia firefighter. Plastic explosives were confiscated by law enforcement officials at five locations in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Looker was taken into custody after arranging to sell the blueprints for $50,000 to an undercover FBI agent, whom he believed to be a representative of an international terrorist group. In 1998 Looker was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Two other defendants were sentenced on explosives charges, and the firefighter drew a year in prison for providing blueprints. The charges with those who were judge include conspiracy to manufacture explosives, transport explosives across state lines and place them near the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services center in Clarksburg. Two of the arrested, Edward Moore and Jack Phillips, were charged for the making and dealing in explosives, including homemade nitroglycerine and C-4. Before the arrests, Moore said to Mr. Looker and the Government informer that he had perfected a homemade rocket-propelled grenade. Also, the authorities said, the group held a training practices in which they detonated an improvised explosive that left a hole two feet wide and four feet deep.
Other arrested were James R. Rogers, (40) a firefighter from Clarksburg. He is accused for the providing of 12 photographs of blueprints of the FBI complex, including plans for the underground computer center, with the objective to attack that part of the complex. The group also posted a video on the internet called "America Under Siege," alleging acts authorized by the federal government against its own people.
===Convictions===
On 29 March 1998, the leader Floyd "Ray" Looker was convicted and sentenced to 18 years in a federal prison. Looker (57), was among the first to be charged under a 1994 antiterrorism law that makes it a crime to provide material resources to terrorists activities. While Looker pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charges, on several occasions he mentioned that the plans and materials he had couldn't have made the attack successful. James R. Rogers, was sentenced to 10 years.
== Notes ==The 'Gamelan Council – Asia-Pacific Public Health, Microfinance, and Development Centre' ('Gamelan Council') is an international non-governmental, non-profit initiative addressing the public health, microfinance, and international development needs of communities in, on, and around the Pacific Rim.  For these purposes, the Gamelan Council views the Asia-Pacific region quite broadly in line with APEC; the jurisdictions covered are claimed to account for approximately 65% of the world's population.  The Council's activities, which include conducting research, making investments, and providing education and advice, are centrally coordinated.
==History==
The Gamelan Council is an offshoot of the Global Consulting Group (GCG), a non-profit, non-partisan consulting firm created under the aegis of Global Student Response (GSR) and focused on supporting international development efforts which has since been disbanded.  As GCG's efforts became more geographically focused on the Asia-Pacific region and thematically focused on public health and microfinance developmental issues, the Gamelan Council formed to focus specifically on these areas.
The name of the organization is a combination of the Indonesian word referring to a music ensemble, 'Gamelan', and an English word referring to a Native American, community-fostering ritual, 'Council' (the same term used to refer commonly to a group of individuals providing advice and counsel).  These two terms capture the Gamelan Council's goal of harmoniously unifying the arrays of forces and ideas affecting the areas on which the Gamelan Council focuses its efforts.
==Jurisdictions addressed==
The Gamelan Council operates predominantly in 73 states and territories on, near, and around the Pacific Rim, including every jurisdiction with a coastline on the Pacific Ocean and several other, significant population centres adjacent to or closely linked to the Pacific Rim (e.g., India, Nepal, and Pakistan).  In 2010, the Gamelan Council also commenced pilot projects in both (a) Central Asia (i.e., Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) and (b) South America (i.e., Paraguay, Uruguay, Guyana, and Suriname) which complement its other activities centered on the Pacific Rim.
These jurisdictions are divided into three main geographic groups and are listed below, organized generally by geography (i.e., Americas from north to south; Asia from west to north and then south; and Oceania from west to east):

==Key activities==
The Gamelan Council focuses on three main sets of activities addressing public health,  microfinance, and international development issues.  These include (a) research (e.g., conducting targeted studies of trends in the public health, microfinance, and international development sectors); (b) investment (e.g., raising capital to support successful Asia-Pacific microfinance providers and assisting entrepreneurs developing new technologies addressing public health needs throughout the Asia-Pacific region); and (c) education and advice (e.g., developing seminars, providing consulting services to social entrepreneurs, and coordinating conferences on public health, microfinance, and international development in the Asia-Pacific region).

The result was a tenth successive victory for the Botswana Democratic Party, which won 45 of the 57 elected seats in the National Assembly.
==Electoral system==
The 57 directly-elected members of the National Assembly were elected in single-member constituencies. A further four members were elected from a list nominated by the President, whilst the President and Attorney General became ex officio members.
==Campaign==
The ruling BDP was suffering from internal problems in the build up to the election, with President Ian Khama threatening to expel party leader and former cabinet minister Daniel Kwelagobe, leader of the Barata-Phathi faction within the BDP. Although Khama and Kwelagobe made amends, stability within the BDP remained open to question. The BDP campaign focussed on its record in government, including education, training and economic development.
Botswana National Front leader Otsweletse Moupo did not contest the elections after losing the party's primary elections for his Gaborone West North seat. It was speculated that he would try to get his party's nomination in Gaborone South, but ultimately Moupo declined to run. Its campaign centred on creating a strong civil society and improving social welfare and housing.
The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) and the Botswana Alliance Movement (BAM) formed an electoral alliance and supported each other's candidates. BCP leader Gilson Saleshando stood for election in Selebi-Phikwe West, a constituency held prior to the election by BDP candidate Kavis Kario. The alliance's campaign included a pledge to stop the economic downturn.
The Botswana People's Party (BPP) campaign focussed on agricultural development and manufacturing, whilst the MELS Movement of Botswana (MELS) promised to fight the exploitation of the population.
A total of 177 candidates contested the elections; 57 from the BDP, 48 from the BNF, 46 from the BCP-BAM alliance (42 from the BCP and 4 from the BAM), 6 from the BPP, 4 from MELS, one from the Botswana Tlhoko Tiro Organisation and 15 independents.
==Opinion polls==
Very few scientific opinion polls were taken prior to the election, preventing accurate measures of public sentiment.

==Conduct==
Early voting was planned for police and polling officers on 29 September, as they would be unable to vote on election day. However, because of a printing error at the Johannesburg-based printer that was responsible for printing the ballot papers, early voting could not proceed as planned; ballot numbers, which should be unique to counter election fraud, were sometimes repeated on the ballots for local elections. As a result Police officers and polling officers had to vote on 16 October, along with the general public. For officers stationed far away from the place they are registered to vote, this presented serious problems. The BCP threatened legal action against the Independent Electoral Commission.
Election turnout was reported to be high with polling station opening times being extending to cope with large queues.  Election observers stated that the overall process ran smoothly, although in some instance people had been unable to vote. The Southern African Development Community noted that the elections were "credible, peaceful, free and fair", but raised concerns about the "slow polling process".
==Results==
Nehemiah Modubule, MP for Lobatse, won re-election running as an independent, having been elected in 2004 as a BNF candidate.
==Aftermath==
President Khama was sworn in for a second term on 20 October, and a victory rally took place in Gaborone on 18 October.

==References=='General elections' were held in Tunisia on 25 October 2009. Results released on 26 October 2009 indicated a substantial victory for incumbent President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who won the reelection for a fifth five-year term, and the governing Constitutional Democratic Rally. It was the last election contested under the Ben Ali regime, prior to the Tunisian Revolution.
==Observers==
The African Union sent a team of election observers to cover the election.  The delegation was led by Benjamin Bounkoulou who described the election as "free and fair". However, a spokesperson from the United States State Department indicated that Tunisia did not allow international monitoring of elections, but the U.S. was still committed to working with the president of Tunisia and its government. There also were reports of mistreatment of an opposition candidate.
==Results==
===President===
The Interior Ministry released the official results for the election on Monday 26 October 2009.  Voter turnout was recorded at 89.40% with 4,447,388 of Tunisia's 5.3 million registered voters participating.  In the presidential race, incumbent president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali won 89.62% of the vote.  His nearest rivals were Mohamed Bouchiha with 5.01% of the vote and Ahmed Inoubli with 3.80%, and Ahmed Brahum with 1.57%.
===Parliament===
In the Chamber of Deputies election, the Democratic Constitutional Rally, which had governed continuously from Tunisia's independence from France in 1956 until the Tunisian Revolution, won 84.59% of the vote and 161 seats.  The Movement of Socialist Democrats won 16 seats with 4.63% of the vote, the Popular Unity Party won 12 seats and 3.39% of votes, The Unionist Democratic Union won 9 seats with 2.56%. The remaining 16 seats were divided between the Social Liberal Party, who won eight seats, the Green Party for Progress, who won six and the Movement Ettajdid who won two seats.

He is a Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Distinguished Visiting Research Chair at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. His expertise is in condensed matter theory in strongly correlated electronic systems. In Oct. 2016, he was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize.
He is the author of a book in advanced quantum many-body theory entitled 'Quantum Field Theory of Many-body Systems: From the Origin of Sound to an Origin of Light and Electrons' (Oxford University Press, 2004).
==Early life==
In 1982, Wen came to the US for graduate school via the CUSPEA program, which was organized by Prof. T. D. Lee.
==Work==
Wen studied superstring theory under theoretical physicist Edward Witten at Princeton University where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1987. He later switched his research field to condensed matter physics while working with theoretical physicists Robert Schrieffer, Frank Wilczek, Anthony Zee in Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara
(1987–1989).
Wen introduced the notion of topological order (1989) and quantum order (2002), to describe a new class of matter states. This opens up a new research direction in condensed matter physics. He found that states with topological order contain non-trivial boundary excitations and developed chiral Luttinger theory for the boundary states (1990). The boundary states can become ideal conduction channel which may lead to device application of topological phases. He proposed the simplest topological order — 'Z'2 topological order (1990), which turns out to be the topological order in the toric code. He also proposed a special class of topological order: non-Abelian quantum Hall states. They contain emergent particles with non-Abelian statistics which generalizes the well known Bose and Fermi statistics. Non-Abelian particles may allow us to perform fault tolerant quantum computations. With Michael Levin, he found that string-net condensations can give rise to a large class of topological orders (2005). In particular, string-net condensation provides a unified origin of photons, electrons, and other elementary particles (2003). It unifies two fundamental phenomena: gauge interactions and Fermi statistics. He pointed out that topological order is nothing but the pattern of long range entanglements. This led to a notion of symmetry protected topological (SPT) order (short-range entangled states with symmetry) and its description by group cohomology of the symmetry group (2011). The notion of SPT order generalizes the notion of topological insulator to interacting cases. He also proposed the SU(2) gauge theory of high temperature superconductors (1996).

The boulevard provides grade-separated dual carriageway in almost its entire length of 11.4 km, running from the north-west to the south-east. It begins in the city center, at Orlov Most (Eagle's Bridge), before which it is called Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard. In its east end, at the Sofia Ring Road, the boulevard becomes part of the Trakia motorway (A1).  The maximum allowed speed on Tsarigradsko shose is 80 km/h between Orlov Most and Gorublyane neighbourhood.
To the south the boulevard borders with Sofia's largest park, the Borisova Gradina, which hosts the National Stadium Vasil Levski and Bulgarian Army Stadium. A number of departments of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences are situated along the road in the area of the Fourth Kilometer Square, as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Polygraphic plant, Arena Armeec, Sofia Tech Park and several hotels including the emblematic Pliska Hotel. In the outskirts of the city there are a lot of hypermarkets and office buildings constructed along the boulevard. Reconstruction and resurfacing are ongoing since 2013 to improve safety and comfort.
On April 25, 2012, Tsarigradsko shose Metro Station started operation with large underground park-and-ride. Nearby the metro station, the highrise of Capital Fort was completed in 2015.
The boulevard bears the old Bulgarian name of the city of Istanbul (medieval Constantinople), 'Tsarigrad', as it leads southeastwards out of the city, towards Plovdiv and Istanbul.

Prime Minister Hans Enoksen announced the election date on 15 April 2009, stating that he would prefer for a newly elected parliament to administer Greenland when the self-government reform took effect on 21 June 2009. The reform gave more power to the Greenlandic parliament with decisions on most issues being devolved to the parliament but defence and foreign affairs remaining under the control of Denmark.
==Results==
The pro-independence, left-wing opposition party, Inuit Ataqatigiit led by Kuupik Kleist emerged as the largest party with 43.7% of the vote. Kleist set a new record for most votes in a Greenlandic election with 5,461 received. This compares with Akitsinnguaq Olsen who was elected with just 112 votes.
The governing Siumut led by Prime Minister Hans Enoksen received 26.5% of the vote and lost control of the government for the first time in 30 years. Former Siumut leader and Prime Minister Jonathan Motzfeldt failed to be re-elected for the first time since 1971, receiving just 91 votes . Enoksen stated that he would step down as party leader, a position he had held since 2002, if his colleagues wished him to. Siumut was believed to have lost votes over a series of scandals, including one over expenses, and concerns over its ability to manage with greater autonomy.
The newly formed Sorlaat Partiiat gained just 383 votes in the election and dissolved shortly afterwards. The party stood on a platform of huge spending reductions and opposed Greenland rejoining the EU.
==Aftermath==
Siumut was considered likely to be left out of government as both the Inuit Ataqatigiit and Demokraatit parties ruled out the possibility of working with them. Siumut's former coalition partner, Atassut, gained too few seats to make a new coalition powerful enough to challenge for the government.
On 7 June 2009, Inuit Ataqatigiit announced that it would form a coalition with the Democrats and the Association of Candidates.
==References=='General elections' to elect the president, Assembly of the Republic, and Provincial Assemblies was held in Mozambique on 28 October 2009. Incumbent President Armando Guebuza ran for re-election as the FRELIMO candidate; he was challenged by opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama, who had stood as the RENAMO candidate in every presidential election since 1994. Also standing were Daviz Simango, the Mayor of Beira, who was a RENAMO member before founding his own party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), earlier in 2009.
==Campaign==
Campaigning for the election began on 13 September 2009. There were 17 parties and two coalitions competing in the parliamentary election. Provincial assemblies were also at stake in the election. Citing problems in the papers submitted by the MDM when it filed to run, the National Elections Commission barred it from contesting the parliamentary election in nine out of 13 regions. Simango, who insisted there were no problems with the papers, was allowed to stand as a presidential candidate.
Prior to the election, Guebuza was heavily favored to win another term, and RENAMO, mired in a bitter feud with Simango and the MDM, was thought to have been seriously weakened since the previous election, held in 2004. On 14 October 2009, 20 minor parties backed Simango's candidacy. The Independent Party of Mozambique (PIMO), another minor party, chose to support Guebuza.
On the last day of campaigning, 25 October, each of the three main candidates held major rallies. At FRELIMO's rally in Nampula, Guebuza stressed a commitment to fighting poverty and working for "national unity, peace and development". Dhlakama concluded his campaign with rallies in Maputo, and he criticized the predominant role of FRELIMO in society: "Everything is mixed together today in Mozambique. The party, the police, schools, roads, journalists—everything has to be through FRELIMO. This has to stop." Simango, meanwhile, held his last rally in Beira, declaring that it was time to "end the games, end the abuses"; he pointed to the problems of unemployment and lack of medicine in hospitals when urging his supporters to turn out for the vote.
Voting at central Maputo's Polana secondary school on election day, Dklahama said that if he lost the election he would not run for president again. He also called for a high turnout, while stressing the importance of respecting the results and avoiding a post-election dispute.
==Results==
According to provisional results announced on 2 November, incumbent president Guebuza won a landslide victory with about 75% of the vote. Turnout was estimated at about 42%. SADC observers said the election result was "a true reflection of the will of the people of Mozambique". Opposition party RENAMO was less content with the electoral conduct, demanding that the election be annulled. According to RENAMO spokesperson Ivone Soares, FRELIMO supporters stuffed ballot boxes with multiple votes and were assisted in doing so by the electoral commission, which provided them with additional ballot papers. A FRELIMO spokesperson, Edson Macuacua, dismissed the allegations, asserting that the election was free and fair and characterizing RENAMO as "lost and desperate".
On 11 November, the National Elections Commission officially announced that Guebuza had won the election with 75% of the vote; Dhlakama and Simango trailed with 16.5% and 8.6% respectively. Results for the parliamentary election were also announced, showing that FRELIMO had won 191 seats, followed by RENAMO with 51 seats and eight for the MDM. The Constitutional Council confirmed the results on 28 December. Continuing to allege fraud, Dhlakama said that RENAMO would boycott the opening of parliament.
After the newly elected deputies were sworn in, they elected Veronica Macamo, a FRELIMO Deputy, as president of the Assembly of the Republic in January 2010. Macamo was the only candidate for the position.

==References=='Wahsatch' ( ) is a ghost town in Summit County, Utah, United States. It lies along I-80 at the northeastern end of Echo Canyon some  east of Echo, and  west of Evanston, Wyoming. Wahsatch was established as a railroad camp, later achieving local prominence in sheep ranching. It was inhabited from 1868 until the 1930s.
==History==
Wahsatch was established in 1868 as a railroad construction camp, the first of many such camps set up in Utah by the Union Pacific Railroad in the process of building the First Transcontinental Railroad. From 1868 to 1869 a population of hundreds dug the  Echo tunnel through the Wasatch Mountains west of town. Wahsatch soon became a major supply station and railhead, with its own roundhouse, workshops, boarding houses, and warehouses. When the transcontinental railroad was finished in May 1869, a meal station for waiting passengers was constructed.
During the tunnel construction in 1868–1869, Wahsatch was known as a wild and lawless place. Laborers spent their wages immediately in tent saloons. Shootings were common, and there is even record of a lynching. Lacking a formal cemetery, the town buried its dead in makeshift hillside graves. This violent period was short-lived; in the early 1870s Wahsatch's development was outpaced by that of nearby Evanston, Wyoming, and the railroad moved most operations to Evanston. The population sharply dropped, and most of the buildings were demolished. Wahsatch became little more than a point for loading livestock.
Toward the end of the 19th century, Wahsatch enjoyed a minor rebirth as a location central to the area's growing sheep ranches. A number of new dwellings were built as ranchers and laborers began to gather here annually for sheep shearing season. In the spring of 1899 alone, an estimated  of wool was sheared. In June 1903 it was reported that 489 carloads of sheep had arrived at Wahsatch from their winter range. The town grew enough to justify the building of a new school in 1910. In 1916 Wahsatch became the headquarters for the construction of a second railroad tunnel, bringing another temporary surge in population. The railroad built a new depot and section houses in the 1930s, but Wahsatch soon declined, along with the sheep industry. The town was abandoned in the 1930s.
The townsite on the north side of the highway is on railroad property, but the ruins on the south side are on a public road and can be accessed. Most visitors see little more than an old wooden sign reading 'Wahsatch' alongside the tracks, but there are some remnants of railroad buildings and equipment.

It is based on the 14th-century Chinese play 'Tale of the Pipa' ('Pi-Pa-Ji') by Gao Ming. Though not a great success, the show is significant for Mary Martin's meeting of then-unknown cast member Yul Brynner, whom she later recommended to her friends Rodgers and Hammerstein for the role of the Siamese monarch in the classic 'The King and I', which premiered on Broadway in 1951. It was also the only Broadway appearance of future U.S. First Lady Nancy Reagan.
==Development==
Cyril Birch, collaborator in a translation of 'The Peach Blossom Fan', wrote that presumably the basis of the American play was the 1846 Antoine (A. P. L.) Bazin French translation of the Chinese play 'Tale of the Pipa'.
==Plot==
The plot focuses on Tsai-Yong (Cai Yong), a young student who leaves his wife Tchao-Ou-Niang and parents to make a name for himself. He becomes a notable magistrate, but when he marries Princess Nieou-Chi, he is forbidden by her father to contact his family. His impoverished parents die of starvation during a famine, and Tchao-Ou-Niang is forced to sell her hair to pay for their funeral. She ultimately is reunited with her husband by Nieou-Chi, and is welcomed to the palace as his #1 wife.
Unlike the original work, Tsai-Yong has to decide between love and filial piety. Ultimately Tsai-Yong and Tchao-Ou-Niang are united.
==Production==
The Broadway production was directed by John Houseman and was produced by Michael Meyerberg.  It opened at the Plymouth Theatre on February 6, 1946 and closed on June 8 of the same year after running for 142 performances. Scenic, costume, and lighting design were by Robert Edmond Jones.
The cast included Yul Brynner as Tsai-Yong, Mary Martin as Tchao-Ou-Niang, Mildred Dunnock and Augustin Duncan as the parents, and Helen Craig as Nieou-Chi. Appearing as Si-Tchun, a Lady-in-Waiting, was Nancy Davis, making her first and only Broadway appearance.
A London production opened at the Winter Garden on October 11, 1948, produced by Albert de Courville and starring Brynner and Dolly Haas.
One factor in the change to the ending was the efforts of Mary Martin and her husband Richard Halliday, who acted as her manager, because of the belief that "'sharing a man was unworthy of a star of Mary's magnitude'".

==Critical reception==
'Time' called it "the season's loveliest production and most charming failure that never quite catches the inner glow of art or the outward stir of theater." It continued, "There should have been either less spectacle or less story. As it is, the old tale is retold at considerable length, but loses much of its flow and human feeling through gorgeous interruptions and sumptuous distractions. What's more, neither the writing nor the acting has quite the stylized quality it reaches after."

* List of South Korean films of 2008'Lies Across America', a 1999 book by James Loewen, is a sequel to his 1995 work 'Lies My Teacher Told Me'. The book focuses on historical markers and museums across the United States, arguing that every historic site is "a tale of two eras": the one from when the event happened and the one from when the event was commemorated.
The survey starts on the West Coast and moves east, a deliberate break from the traditional American history found in textbooks, which begin with the Pilgrims and follow westward expansion. Loewen prioritizes American Indian history and the explorers of New Spain over British colonization.
Loewen's book voices two major complaints about historical markers in the United States. The first deals with historical markers established in the Southern United States that attempt to whitewash the history of slavery and the period of Reconstruction. Many of these markers were established between 1890 and 1920, the nadir of American race relations. Most were placed by organizations with pro-Confederate agendas and reflect the racism of the early 20th century. While some markers have been altered in the last 40 years as a result of civil rights progress, many have not, especially those at American Civil War battle sites and in the South.
Loewen's second major complaint deals with the treatment of Native Americans, who are often neglected and omitted in the telling of United States history. The author challenges and corrects many of the inaccurate and Eurocentric mistruths spread by historical markers across America.
At the end of his book, Loewen makes suggestions for how those concerned about the misrepresentation of history can change markers and monuments to convey historical truth and accuracy. The organizations running historical sites are faulted in Loewen's book according to Wilton Corkern.

*  Review in 'The American Prospect'
*  Excerpt in 'The New York Times'One of the container terminals of the port and the city of Genoa in the background
The 'Port of Genoa' is the major seaport of Italy, in competition with the ports of Marseille and Barcelona in the Mediterranean Sea. With a trade volume of 51.6 million tonnes, it is the busiest port of Italy by cargo tonnage.
Notably the port was used for dismantling the 'Costa Concordia' following the 'Costa Concordia' disaster.
==Structural characteristics==
The ferry terminal
The Port of Genoa covers an area of about 700 hectares of land and 500 hectares on water, stretching for over 22 kilometres along the coastline, with 47 km of maritime ways and 30 km of operative quays.
There are 4 main entrances:
* the Eastern inlet, affording access to the old port, to the shipyards, and to the terminals of Sampierdarena
* the Western (Cornigliano) inlet, used mostly by ships operating at the ILVA quays
* the Multedo entrance, for ships operating in the oil terminals and to the Fincantieri shipyards
* the Pra' entrance, at the western end of the port, for ships operating at the container terminal
==Passenger terminals==
The quays of the passenger terminals extend over an area of 250 thousand square metres, with 5 equipped berths for cruise vessels and 13 for ferries, for an annual capacity of 4 million ferry passengers, 1.5 million cars and 250,000 trucks.
The historical maritime station of Ponte dei Mille is today a technologically advanced cruise terminal, with facilities designed after the world's most modern airports, in order to ensure fast embarking and disembarking of latest generation ships carrying thousand passengers.
A third cruise terminal is currently under construction in the redesigned area of Ponte Parodi, once a quay used for grain traffic.
==Lighthouses==
There are two major lighthouses: the historical Lanterna,  tall, and the small lighthouse of Punta Vagno, at the eastern entrance of the port.
==Marinas==
The marina of the Exhibition centre, home of the Genoa International Boat Show
Besides the container and the passenger terminals, the shipyards and the other industrial and cargo facilities, in the port area there are also several marinas, where many sailboats and yachts are moored.
* The marina of the Exhibition centre (305 berths).
* The marina Duca degli Abruzzi, home of the Yacht Club Italiano (350 berths)
* The marina Molo Vecchio, in the area of the old harbor (160 berths for yachts up to 150 metres)
* The marina Porto antico (280 berths up to 60 metres)
* The marina Genova Aeroporto (500 berths, with new facilities for superyachts)
* The marina of Pra', in the area of the old Pra' beach, now "Fascia di Rispetto di Pra'" (1000 berths)

==External links=='Market Place Shopping Center' is an enclosed shopping mall located in Champaign, Illinois, US. The mall's anchor stores are Dick's Sporting Goods, Field & Stream, JCPenney, Macy's, and Costco Wholesale. It is the second largest enclosed shopping mall in Central Illinois.
==History==
The mall opened in 1975 and was originally anchored by Sears, JCPenney and Bergner's.
The shopping center acquired a Tuscany-themed Italian villa setting as part of a renovation and expansion project, completed in August 1999. This project added on a Famous-Barr department store and  brought the mall up to  of gross leasable area.
In May 2004, JCPenney, which had left the property and the region 5 years earlier, re-entered the mall as an anchor. In 2006, Famous-Barr rebranded as Macy's following Macy's takeover of May Department Stores, Famous-Barr's parent company.
In 2013, it was announced that Sears would be closing in 2014. Sears had operated in Champaign continuously since 1928, and had been an original anchor at the mall's 1975 opening. The store was demolished. Dick's Sporting Goods and Field & Stream built on that space in October 2015. On January 12, 2018 it was announced that Loft would be closing its store at the mall on January 27. On January 24, 2018 it was announced that H&M would move into the mall. The store will move into the Dick's Sporting Goods wing. The store will move into the Gymboree store, the former Banana Republic store, a temporary Christmas store and the Forever 21 store. Gymboree closed at the end of January. Forever 21 will temporarily move into the JCPenney wing before returning to a new permanent store in the Dick's Sporting Goods wing. It will move into the Payless ShoeSource space, the former European Famous Brands store and the Day Spa. Payless ShoeSource is moving into the vacant Loft store. Day Spa is moving into the MasterCuts space which closed on January 26.
Bergner's closed in August 2018, as part of the closure of the entire Bon-Ton department store network.
In April 2019, it was announced that Costco Wholesale would replace the former Bergner's space by constructing a new store in place of the existing structure. The Costco is expected to be open at the mall in October 2020. Old Navy and LensCrafters have moved to other parts of the mall in order to cut the mall's square footage by 14,000 sq. ft. for the 
construction of the Costco.
In 2020, 7 businesses closed after being in the mall for years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The businesses that closed include Great Steak, Wetzel's Pretzels, Regis Salon, AT&T Store, T-Mobile Store, Villa Italian Kitchen, and Mango Mango Creamery. These are the most closures in the mall at once since 2017.

==References==The '2000 United States Senate election in Delaware' was held on November 7, 2000, in conjunction with the 2000 U.S. presidential election, other elections to the United States Senate in other states, as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives, and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator William Roth ran for re-election to a sixth term, but he was defeated by Democratic Governor Tom Carper. Carper subsequently became the first Democrat to hold this seat since 1947.
== Major candidates ==
=== Democratic ===
* Tom Carper, Governor of Delaware and former U.S. Representative
=== Republican ===
* William Roth, Incumbent U.S. Senator first elected in 1970
== Campaign ==
For 16 years, the same four people had held the four major statewide positions. Because of term limits on the Governor's position, Tom Carper could not run again. Both he and U.S. Representative Michael Castle wanted to be U.S. Senator. Roth would not retire, and fellow Republican Castle decided against a primary.
Roth, 79, was in the U.S. Senate for 30 years. He was the Chairman of the Finance Committee. Carper, 53, was a popular Governor and former U.S. Congressman of Delaware's At-large congressional district, who announced his major candidacy against Roth back in September 1999. Both candidates were moderates. Roth was one of the few Republicans to vote for the Brady Bill. Although Roth started the campaign with a 2-to-1 spending advantage, Carper went into the final month with more than $1 million on hand. In a contest between two popular and respected politicians, the issue seemed to be Roth's age versus Carper's relative youth.
Carper defeated Roth by over ten points. Roth received more votes than Presidential candidate George W. Bush, suggesting the strength of the Democratic turnout was a boon to Carper's candidacy. Some consider Roth's defeat to be due to his age and health, as he collapsed twice during the campaign, once in the middle of a television interview and once during a campaign event.

*+USS 'Timbalier' (AVP-54)
'USS 'Timbalier' (AVP-54)' was a  of the United States Navy. She was commissioned shortly after the end of World War II, and served between 1946 and her decommissioning in 1954. She later saw commercial service as the Greek cruise ship 'MV 'Rodos'.
== Construction and commissioning ==
The launching of USS 'Timbalier' on 18 April 1943.
'Timbalier' was built at the Lake Washington Shipyard, at Houghton, Washington, with her keel laid down on 9 November 1942. She was launched on 18 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs. S. B. Dunlap. 'Timbalier', and her sister , were initially ordered in February 1944 to be completed at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, but were transferred back to the Lake Washington Shipyard in June 1945. The resulting delay meant that she was not commissioned until 24 May 1946. Her first commander was Captain James E. Johnson.
==US Navy career==
'Timbalier' sailed from Seattle, Washington on 20 June 1946, arriving at San Francisco, California two days later on 22 June 1946. She transferred to Alameda, California, where she loaded stores and airplane spare parts before sailing for San Diego, California, on 26 June 1946.

She was based at Trinidad, and carried out operations in the Caribbean and off the United States East Coast. She served with FAW-11 as a tender for their Martin PBM Mariner flying boats for the rest of her naval career. With the increase in the Soviet submarine threat by 1951, the PBM Mariner squadrons were deployed to carry out reconnaissance off the US East Coast, and were to concentrate on convoy defense and antisubmarine warfare in the event of conflict with the Soviet Union, supported by 'Timbalier', her sister ship , and the seaplane tender .
In 1952 'Timbalier' supported flying boat operations during Operation Mainbrace, a large-scale exercise of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's navies, off the Scandinavian and Icelandic coasts;'Timbalier' tended flying boats operating out of Lerwick, in the Shetland Islands.

He has run in different series, with major success in TC 2000, where he finished 3rg in 2009 and 2nd in 2010 driving for the works Honda team.
He is the son of former footballer and racing driver Vicente Pernía, and brother of Spanish international footballer Mariano Pernía. In fact, he played for Boca Juniors First Division in 1997, in the National Professional Soccer League the next two years, then raced at the Argentine Turismo Nacional in 2000 and 2001. Because of the crisis, he returned to the United States to compete in the Major Indoor Soccer League from 2002 to 2005.
In 2006, Pernía retired from football and returned to Argentina to race professionally. That year he competed at the TC Pista in a Chevrolet (12th) and the TC2000 in a Honda (3 races). The next season, Pernía raced two TC Pista races, half of the TC2000 season in a Fineschi Honda and the rest of the year in a works Honda, ending up 13th.
The next years, he continued racing for Honda and was vice-championship in 2009 and 2010. He also raced at the Turismo Nacional Clase 3 in 2008, the Top Race V6 in 2009 and Turismo Carretera since 2009. In 2009 he also won the Drivers Masters karting all-star race in downtown Buenos Aires.
In 2013, 2014 and 2015 he was runner-up in Super TC 2000 (successor to TC 2000) behind Matías Rossi and Néstor Girolami (twice), already with the official Renault Argentina team. In 2018 he won the Turismo Nacional Clase 3 championship with Chetta Racing and the following year the Súper TC 2000 with Renault.

Nixon and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology from 1970 to 1973.
==Life and career==
David earned his doctorate in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1947. He took a job with Bell Telephone Laboratories and worked there from 1950 to 1970, eventually becoming Executive Director, Research. Following the resignation of Lee A. DuBridge, David was appointed as Nixon's science advisor. David resigned in 1973, citing "disappointment that his advice had not been heeded." He then took a position as Executive Vice President of R&D and Planning for Gould, Inc. from 1973 to 1977.
He founded consulting group 'EED, Inc.' in 1977, advising industry, government and universities on technology, research and innovation management. In 1977, he became President of Research and Engineering for Exxon Corporation from 1977 to 1986. In 1983, he was awarded the IRI Medal from the Industrial Research Institute in recognition for his leadership contributions. He joined The Washington Advisory Group in 1997, serving as Treasurer until 2004. He also served as Director of the Ronson Corporation.
David was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1966. In 1974, he was elected to the MIT Corporation and is a Life Member.  He was awarded The Delmer S. Fahrney Medal in 1985.
David was also active in public service to his adopted state, serving on the board of the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology (NJCST) alongside William O. Baker, his former vice president at Bell Labs. In 1982, while still at Exxon, David was appointed by Governor Thomas H. Kean to the Governor's study commission that led to formation of the NJCST. Once the NJCST became a statutory agency with responsibility for the state's programs in science & technology-based economic development in 1985, David was reappointed to its board and served as chair of its budget committee. During this period, he also chaired the Governor's Roundtable on (High-Temperature) Superconductivity, which was staffed by the NJCST. He left the NJCST board in 1990.
In 2012, David was a co-signatory of a Wall Street Journal op-ed questioning the scientific consensus on global warming.
Born in Wilmington, North Carolina on January 25, 1925, David died at his home in Bedminster, New Jersey on February 13, 2017, aged 92.

'Johann Michael Wächter' (2 March 1794 – 26 May 1853) was an Austrian bass-baritone most famous for appearing in the operas of Richard Wagner.
Born in Rappersdorf in Austria, Wächter sang in various church choirs in Vienna, making his stage début in 1819 at Graz as Don Giovanni in  Mozart's 'Don Giovanni'. He also appeared at Bratislava, Vienna and Berlin. In 1827 he joined the Dresden Hofoper, where he remained for the rest of his career. Here his roles included Mozart's 'The Marriage of Figaro', and he sang in three Wagner premières, playing Orsini in 'Rienzi' in 1842, The Dutchman in 'The Flying Dutchman' ('Der Fliegende Holländer') in 1843, and Biterolf in 'Tannhäuser' in 1845.
The last scene of Wagner's 'The Flying Dutchman' (1843)
Hector Berlioz, who heard 'The Flying Dutchman' in Dresden, considered Wächter's baritone ‘...one of the finest I have ever heard, and he uses it like a consummate singer. It is of that rich and vibrant timbre that has such a wonderful power of expression, provided that the artist sings with soul and feeling, which Wächter does to a high degree’.
Wächter, an old friend of Wagner's, was not equal to the demanding role of the Dutchman. Wagner later wrote:
"His total incapacity in the difficult role of my spectral, suffering mariner dawned on Schröder-Devrient unfortunately only after the rehearsals were too far along to make any change. Wächter's distressing corpulence, particularly his broad, round face and the curious way he moved his arms and legs like shrivelled stumps, sent my Senta in transports of despair."
His wife, the mezzo-soprano Thérèse Wächter-Wittman (born 31 August 1802 in Vienna), also sang at Dresden, creating the role of Mary in 'The Flying Dutchman'. Wächter died in Dresden in 1853.

*'Keep' Danny Choo is one of the most successful bloggers in the world, and his website is consistently in the top 10,000 most visited sites in the world (sites, not blogs), not bad for a non-commercial site. Though huge in Japan and east Asia, visitors from the United States now double visitors from Japan. His Tokyo Dance Trooper videos have made him an internet celebrity. After briefly appearing in two CNN reports about the Japanese iPhone launch, he appeared on G4's 'Attack of the Show!'. CNN then did a report about him, which was the most popular video on CNN.com that day. I can't help but be concerned when far less notable people have articles about them on Wikipedia. If someone as well known as Danny Choo doesn't deserve an article, how many thousands of other notable people need to lose their articles as well? How high do we really want to set the bar here? If being famous isn't a criteria for notability, should we limit ourselves to heads of state? Maybe call it Diplomapedia?

Born in Elsecar, West Riding of Yorkshire, he played for several clubs in The Football League, including Notts County, Clapton Orient and Manchester United.
==Football career==
Born in Elsecar, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Pape began his football career with Wath Athletic, a club from the nearby town of Wath-upon-Dearne. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, Pape joined the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and played for the regimental football team, returning to play for Bolton-on-Dearne at the cessation of hostilities. In December 1919, Pape was signed by Rotherham County, who had been elected to the Football League Second Division at the start of the season, and he made a goalscoring debut on 17 January 1920 in a 4–3 win over Coventry City. In four seasons with Rotherham County, Pape scored 41 goals in 113 league appearances, including a spell in the 1922–23 season in which he scored eight goals in five matches.
He signed for Notts County at the end of that season, but made just six appearances in 1923–24 before moving on to Clapton Orient. In eight months with Orient, he scored 11 goals in 24 league matches. In February 1925, Orient travelled to a match against a Manchester United side that had just sold its star striker, Bill Henderson, to Preston North End. United manager John Chapman had telephoned the Orient manager Peter Proudfoot before they left London, and the two clubs agreed a fee of £1,070 for Pape. They met up at Manchester Piccadilly station just after noon, and Pape – who was a friend of the United captain Frank Barson, and had relatives in nearby Bolton – quickly agreed terms. The details were wired to The Football Association and The Football League at around 1:30 p.m., and although Pape had been named in Orient's starting line-up for the match, he was confirmed as a Manchester United player with about an hour left before kick-off. Pape was not only allowed to start the match in the colours of Manchester United, but he also scored the team's third goal in a 4–2 win over his previous employers, as well as hitting the post with a header late in the game. He made 15 further appearances that season, and scored four more goals. He also made two appearances in 1925–26, but he was then sold to Fulham in October 1925. However, he was reluctant to return to London, and only signed with Fulham on the condition that he could continue to live in Bolton and train with Manchester United. Five months later, the two clubs met in the Sixth Round of the FA Cup, and although Pape scored, Manchester United won the match 2–1.
After two seasons with Fulham, in which he scored 12 goals in 42 appearances, Pape dropped out of League football to join North Wales coast side Rhyl Athletic, but he was there for less than six months before joining Hurst back in Manchester for the second half of the 1927–28 season. He scored at a rate of almost one goal a game, and even scored a hat-trick on his debut against Port Vale Reserves in the Cheshire County League. Towards the end of the season, the club suffered a goalkeeping injury crisis, and Pape was forced to play one match in goal. In September 1928, Pape was named as player-coach at Darwen, and was also made club captain. However, five months later, he was signed by Manchester Central, before returning to League football for the start of the 1929–30 season with Hartlepools United. He scored 21 goals in 37 appearances for Hartlepools United in the Football League Third Division North, and was signed by Halifax Town for one final season of League football in July 1930, scoring 15 goals in 25 appearances in 1930–31. He spent time with Burscough Rangers, Horwich RMI and Nelson before retiring from football.

==Background==
Bred by Liz Person and raced under her Llangollen Farm banner, Porterhouse was a son of the Argentine-bred Endeavour who also sired Corn Husker, Prove It and Pretense, three top runners who each won the Santa Anita Handicap. His dam was Red Stamp, a daughter of the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Bimelech.
Conditioned for racing by Charlie Whittingham, Porterhouse was the forty-year-old trainer's first stakes winner and first Champion.
==Racing career==
In 1953, Porterhouse won East Coast races including the National Stallion Stakes and the then most important race for his age group, the Belmont Futurity Stakes. Porterhouse also won the 1953 Saratoga Special Stakes but was disqualified and set back to last.
Porterhouse was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt by the 'Daily Racing Form' and the Thoroughbred Racing Association. The rival poll organized by Turf & Sports Digest magazine was topped by Hasty Road.
In 1954, three-year-old Porterhouse had a sub-par year in racing, with his only important win coming in the Old Knickerbocker Handicap. The colt did not run in either of the first two races of the U.S. Triple Crown series and finished ninth in the Belmont Stakes won by High Gun. During the next three years in racing, Porterhouse  returned to his winning ways at racetracks in California. He captured several top events, highlighted by his win over future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Swaps in the 1956 Californian Stakes and the Hollywood Express Handicap in world record time for five and a half furlongs on dirt at Hollywood Park Racetrack.
==Stud career==
Retired to stud duty, Porterhouse met with reasonable success, siring several good runners including Coaching Club American Oaks winner, Our Cheri Amour, and multiple stakes winners Isle of Greece, Port Wine, and Farwell Party.
Porterhouse died at age twenty in 1971 and was buried a The Stallion Station in Lexington, Kentucky.

*  October 12, 1953 'TIME' magazine article on Porterhouse's win in the Belmont Futurity
*  Article on Porterhouse winning the Knickerbocker Handicap in the May 22, 1954 issue of  'The New Yorker' magazine"'The Lovely House'" is a gothic short story and weird tale by American writer Shirley Jackson, first published in 1950. The story features several overtly gothic elements, including a possibly haunted house, doubling, and the blurring of real and imaginary.
The story was later reprinted in Jackson's posthumous collection 'Come Along With Me' in 1968 (published by Viking Press and reprinted by Penguin Classics in 2013) under the title "A Visit." It was also reprinted in the anthology 'American Gothic Tales', edited by Joyce Carol Oates, in 1996.
American literary critic S.T. Joshi claims that "The Lovely House" exemplifies the "'quiet weird tale' at its pinnacle" in its embodiment of "the manner in which a house can subsume its occupants."
== Plot summary ==
"The Lovely House" consists of three main parts. In part one, the main character Margaret starts her summer vacation with her friend Carla Montague. The Montagues' home is a huge and beautifully decorated house that is set among lavish grounds. The house has many themed rooms; for example, there is a fan room, a painted room, and a room with a tile mosaic on the floor. Every room contains one or more tapestries with a picture of the house on it. In the room with the tiles, there's a mosaic of a girl, with the words "Here is Margaret, who died for love." 
In part two, Carla's long-anticipated brother arrives with a friend. Paul, the Captain, Carla, and Margaret pass time in various parts of the grounds. Margaret and Paul often separate from the other two, which seems to disturb Carla. One afternoon when Margaret and Paul are looking at the river, they discuss the tower and Paul tells Margaret that there is an old lady, an Aunt or a Great Aunt or a Great-Great Aunt, that hides away in the tower because she hates the tapestries. Eventually Margaret ascends the tower and meets the old lady, whose name is also Margaret. The encounter goes strangely and Margaret leaves in a hurry.
In part three, the Montagues say farewell to their son by hosting a ball. The old lady shows up at the ball to see and reminisce with Paul. Margaret overhears part of a strange conversation between the two that implies they were young together even though now they appear to be quite different ages. After the ball, the Captain points out the many ways in which the house needs repair. The family immediately become defensive and the meal ends. After breakfast, Margaret and Paul are in the drawing room. Paul becomes defensive about the state of the house, then abruptly takes his leave of Margaret. The family then says goodbye to the Captain. It is at this point in the story that the story makes clear that the Captain is Carla's brother. The story leaves ambiguous what the relationship is between Paul, Margaret, and the elderly Margaret.
== Main themes ==
=== Familial relations ===
When Carla's brother, the Captain, comes home, the family seems to the reader to be complete once again.
=== Psychological ambiguity ===
Carla is always saying that Margaret is acting odd. Margaret believes that she's interacting with Paul, but Carla apparently can't see or hear Paul, so she sees Margaret as spending time by herself.
=== Gothic architecture ===
The tower is old and ruined; this symbolizes Margaret's death and her never-dying love for Paul.

 Bennet Peak'William Martin' (born February 16, 1957 in Bethesda, Maryland) is an American botanist and microbiologist, currently Head of the Institut für Molekulare Evolution, Heinrich Heine Universität, Düsseldorf.
Born in Bethesda, Maryland, Martin was educated at Richland College, Dallas, Texas, and Texas A&M University. After working as a carpenter in Dallas, Martin moved to Hannover, Germany, and obtained his university Diploma from Technische Universität Hannover in 1985. Martin's PhD is from Max-Planck-Institut für Züchtungsforschung, Cologne, where he did postdoctoral research, followed by further postdoctoral work at Institut für Genetik, Technische Universität Braunschweig, where he obtained his Habilitation in 1992. In 1999, Martin became full (C4) professor at Universität Düsseldorf.
Martin is a distinguished and sometimes controversial contributor to the field of molecular evolution. He is known particularly for his work on the evolution of the Calvin cycle and plastids including chloroplasts, and, more generally, for contributions to understanding the origin and evolution of eukaryotic cells. Martin is co-author, with Miklos Mueller of Rockefeller University, of the 1998 paper 'The Hydrogen hypothesis for the first eukaryote'. A wealth of subsequent research papers include contributions, independently and with Michael J. Russell of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to understanding the geochemical origins of cells and their biochemical pathways. Martin's work is well cited (nearly 30,000 times) and he has an h-index of 84.

*  Molecular Evolution'Isaac Campbell Pugh' (November 23, 1805 – November 19, 1874) was a United States volunteer soldier who was a veteran of the Black Hawk War, the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War; rising to the rank of Brevet brigadier general.
==Early life==
Pugh was born in Christian County, Kentucky. He moved to Macon County, Illinois and became a private and served during the Black Hawk War. In 1846 he became a captain in the 4th Illinois Volunteer Regiment during the Mexican War and was mustered out of the volunteer service the following year.
==Civil War==
===Fort Donelson===
Pugh's most notable military service came during the American Civil War. He volunteered and became the captain of Company A of the 8th Illinois Infantry Regiment when it was mustered in on 23 April 1861. When the 8th was demobilized three months later, he formed the 41st Illinois Volunteer Regiment which he commanded as colonel, and would chiefly be associated with for the rest of the war. Pugh led the regiment into action at the Battle of Fort Donelson fighting as part of John McArthur's brigade on the extreme right of the Union line.
===Shiloh===
After Fort Donelson the 41st Illinois was assigned to the 1st Brigade in Stephen A. Hurlbut's 4th Division of the Army of the Tennessee. Shortly after the fighting began at the Battle of Shiloh, the 1st Brigade's commander Col. Nelson G. Williams was severely wounded and command of the brigade was turned over to Pugh. Colonel Pugh ably led the brigade through the two days of fighting at Shiloh in the vicinity of "Bloody Pond".
===Vicksburg and Jackson===
After Shiloh, General Jacob G. Lauman was transferred to command the brigade and Pugh returned to command of his regiment. He led his unit in the subsequent Siege of Corinth and the Battle of Hatchie's Bridge. When General Lauman was elevated to command of the 4th Division, Pugh again assumed command of the 1st Brigade. Pugh's brigade and the rest of the division were assigned to the XVI Corps during the Siege of Vicksburg and the following expedition against Jackson, Mississippi. During the Jackson Expedition, General Lauman ordered Pugh to make an attack against Brig. Gen. Daniel W. Adams' entrenched brigade. This attack resulted in heavy casualties for Pugh's brigade and Lauman was subsequently relieved of command.
===Furlough and Atlanta Campaign===
Pugh continued in brigade command until October 1863 when the veteran officers and soldiers of the 41st Illinois were granted a furlough while the new recruits in the regiment fought in the Red River Campaign and at Tupelo. Pugh returned to active duty with the veterans of the regiment in 1864. Instead of reuniting the entire regiment in Mississippi, Pugh commanded the so-called "Veterans Battalion" of the 41st Illinois and was sent to Georgia to join William T. Sherman's campaign against Atlanta. Pugh's Veteran Battalion was assigned to railroad guard duty near Marietta, Georgia. Pugh briefly commanded the 2nd Brigade, 4th Division in the XVII Corps which was composed of regiments primarily on guard duty in Georgia. He was mustered out of the volunteer service with the rest of his regiment on August 20, 1864.

The result was a Byzantine victory.
== Origins of the conflict ==
In 755, the long peace between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire came to an end. This was mainly because, after significant victories over the Arabs, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V began to fortify his border with Bulgaria. To this aim he resettled heretics from Armenia and Syria in Thrace. Khan Kormisosh took those actions, and the construction of a new fortress along the border, as a breach of the Byzantine–Bulgarian Treaty of 716, signed by Tervel. The Bulgarian ruler sent envoys to ask for tribute for the new fortresses. After the refusal of the Byzantine Emperor, the Bulgarian army invaded Thrace. Looting everything on their way, the Bulgarians reached the outskirts of Constantinople, where they were engaged and defeated by Byzantine troops.
==Battle==
In the next year, Constantine V organized a large campaign against Bulgaria which was now ruled by a new khan, Vinekh. An army was sent with 500 ships which plundered the area around the Danube Delta. The Emperor himself, leading the main force, advanced into Thrace, and was engaged by the Bulgarians at the border castle of Marcellae. The details of the battle are unknown but it resulted in a victory for Constantine V. In order to stop the invasion, the Bulgarians sent hostages to Constantinople. However, three years later (759), Constantine invaded Bulgaria once more, but suffered a crushing defeat in the battle of the Rishki Pass.

:'Very strong oppose'. The last one on the list shows he reason why using an adjectival demonym is hazardous. Even when the basic gist of a weird one like that for Burkina Faso is grabbed, it's still very easy to misspell something like Burkinabé (note the accent). Usual stub naming says that if the permcat is "X in Foo" and "X of Foo", the stub category at "Foo X stubs", and it only becomes "Fooian X stubs" when the permcat is at "Fooian X". For that reason, I'd oppose this, though I'm willing to reconsider if you can convince the people at CFD that the permcats should be at "Fooian politican parties". I would support two changes to the above, though:
::* → 
::* → 
:...per  and . Grutness...'wha?' 20:36, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
*'Strong support' for anything except "Burkina Faso" as normal English language usage.  For that one I'd like to see some evidence about what the normal attributive usage actually 'is'.  This nonsense is all a result of a rod for we've made for our own backs by only coming around by inches to the concept that if you're going to scramble the order of the words in a category name, and sticks "stubs" on the end, there are one or two other grammatical considerations that come into play, such as avoiding double plurals, and, well, this.  Alai (talk) 06:29, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
**On second thoughts, since we have permcats at  and , that seems a perfectly reasonable usage.  Support that one too.  Alai (talk) 06:42, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
***It would certainly be good if we had , but - as I've pointed out elsewhere, permcats often don't use adjectival forms for very good reasons, and we should follow suit in those cases. Creating an artificial "Stubcats use adjectives even when permcats deliberately don't" is far worse than the"Stub Grammar (TM)" idea of us using adjectives when permcats use adjectives and nouns when permcats use nouns. Grutness...'wha?' 22:40, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
****What do you mean, "deliberately don't"?  I've demonstrated that there's no such systematic avoidance: some use noun phrases, 'with propositions', others use adjectives attributively.  It is not "following the permcats" to junk the prepositions, but keep the noun phrase as is, regardless of whether that's an idiomatic usage.  That is something that 'no permcat naming scheme would ever do', so to characterise in that manner is entirely wrong-headed.  I can't think of any much more "artificial" than to have a mixture of "Ukraine" and "Ukrainian" 'both being used attributively', and nor do I see it as helpful to anyone on the (relatively rare) instances where someone has to remember the actual category: quite the reverse, in fact.  Things have been heading this way for some time, and frankly if you had some deep-seated objection, you really should have spoken up fore now.  Alai (talk) 04:13, 1 December 2008 (UTC)

No further edits should be made to this section.''Chill' is a 2007 horror film written and directed by Serge Rodnunsky and starring Thomas Calabro, Ashley Laurence, Shaun Kurtz, and James Russo.
==Development and plot==
The film was based on H. P. Lovecraft's "Cool Air". Similar plot elements include the fact that the doctor in the film (played by Shaun Kurtz) is named Dr. Muñoz as in Lovecraft's story, and must live in refrigerated conditions in order to survive. There is also a mention of the Necronomicon in the film; while this does not occur in Lovecraft's "Cool Air", it does serve in the movie as a clue to its Lovecraftian inspiration. Part of the plot hinges on the refrigeration system breaking down, again as in the Lovecraft story. Physically, the character of Dr Muñoz in the film does not resemble the character described in Lovecraft's story, nor does he speak with a Spanish accent.
Overall, however, the plot of the movie moves away from the Lovecraft story in depicting Muñoz as the controller of a serial killer preying on prostitutes. Muñoz lives in the back of a deli which he runs, and the protagonist Sam (Thomas Calabro), a writer who comes to work at the deli for survival money, gets dragged into the web of killings. Sam also falls in love with a woman named Maria (Ashley Laurence) who runs a clothing stores across the street and is being threatened by a local cop, Detective Defazio (James Russo), whom she dated once.
The DVD packaging for the Australian release through Flashback Entertainment does not feature Lovecraft's name anywhere, though the American packaging indicates that Lovecraft's tale inspired the movie. The film is omitted from Charles P. Mitchell's otherwise fairly comprehensive 'The Complete H.P. Lovecraft Filmography' (Greenwood Press, 2001), possibly because the makers of 'Chill' did not overtly capitalise on Lovecraft's name.
The 'Pittsburgh Post-Gazette' summarizes the plot as "Let's just say someone dies but cheats Death by harvesting flesh and dabbling in the occult."

==Reception==
The film won Best Achievement in Fantasy and Horror at the Worldfest International Film Festival, was nominated for Best Horror Feature Film at the Shockerfest International Film Festival, and was an Official Selection at both the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival and World Horror Convention in Toronto.  DVD Verdict gave the film a reasonably complimentary review, while 'Home Theater Info' is definitely praiseful of the film asking readers of the review to "give this movie a chance and enjoy."  'Slasherpool.com' described a number of positives (the casting and directing) and negatives (the pacing and atmosphere).  The DVD box art includes a quotation from the 'Slasherpool.com' review: "'Saw' meets 'Nosferatu'."

;Evidence
Two 'Three' SPA accounts with almost identical names. It doesn't get any more obvious than this.
;Comments
Yes, which is why there's no point in opening a report in cases like this. Two accounts who are obviously the same new user, but no abuse. More than likely it's a newbie who forgot the password to his first account.--chaser - t 19:22, 29 November 2008 (UTC) 
:I'm restoring and refiling this so another admin can have a look. Removing the AFD tag  is more abuse than I initially saw, but I expect these accounts to all go inactive by the time the AFD closes. Block? Or just leave them tagged?--chaser - t 20:06, 29 November 2008 (UTC)
:It has become very clear during the course of the AfD Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jen Aggleton, the article these accounts created and edited, Jen Aggleton, is a deliberate hoax article, carefully constructed to appear as a legitimate article. This seems to me to qualify as vandalism and deliberate disruption. I think that all three LordMorley accounts should be indef blocked. Nsk92 (talk) 23:44, 29 November 2008 (UTC) 
*It was suggested at the AfD that this is a returning banned user, but I'm not sure what that was based on. Even if it is, they will probably move on to another new name, if they haven't already, seeing as they've been "caught". On the other hand, I don't see any harm in simply blocking all three and seeing if they ever bother to come back and appeal the block. Beeblebrox (talk) 00:34, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
**The article Jen Aggleton has been deleted as CSD G3 (vandalism). I still think it is a good idea to indef block all three LordMorley accounts, as a preventive measure, so that they are not used for further disruption. Nsk92 (talk) 02:38, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
;Conclusions
Not too concerned about the "sockpuppetry" itself, but due to the creation of what is clearly a hoax article, and the unclear relationship with User:Boshinoi (who appears to be a banned user or an imitator of a banned user, and who showed up to comment at the AFD), I think it prudent, per Nsk92, to block all three indef as vandalism only accounts, to prevent further mischief (at least by these three accounts) later on. --barneca (talk) 22:54, 22 December 2008 (UTC)
:To clarify, blocking indef is valid even if there is no relationship to Boshinoi; but the possibility of a relationship is a reason to bother to go thru the motions of blocking inactive accounts, rather than just leave it alone. --barneca (talk) 23:07, 22 December 2008 (UTC)
----'William Doud Packard' (November 3, 1861 – November 11, 1923) was an American automobile manufacturer who founded the Packard Motor Car Company and Packard Electric Company with his brother James Ward Packard.
==Life and career==
Packard was born in Warren, Ohio on November 3, 1861, to Warren and Mary Elizabeth Doud Packard. While his younger brother James Ward Packard (1863-1928) joined him in founding the Packard Electric Company there in 1890 where they manufactured incandescent carbon arc lamps, his sister Alaska P. Davidson (1868-1934) later became the first female FBI agent. 
After disappointment with a Winton Company car he purchased, James formed a partnership with his brother and Winton investor George L. Weiss called Packard & Weiss. The first Packard automobile was released in 1899. In 1900, the company incorporated as the Ohio Automobile Company and was renamed the Packard Motor Car Company in 1902. The company relocated to Detroit in 1903. The company eventually merged with the Studebaker Corporation in 1954, and the last Packard was made in 1958.
Following Packard Motor Company's relocation to Detroit, the Packard brothers focused on making automotive electrical systems through the separate Packard Electric Company. General Motors acquired Packard Electric in 1932, renaming it Delphi Packard Electric Systems in 1995. The company was spun off and became independent of GM in 1999. 
In 1915, W.D. Packard commissioned a summer home to be designed by a famous architectural firm in New York City, Warren and Wetmore. This home is located on the Chautauqua Institution. It still serves as a single-family residence. There is a duplicate in Warren, Ohio.
Packard Park in Warren, Ohio is on land donated by Packard, and the W.D. Packard Music Hall and Packard Band were funded by him.

==Family and education==
The son of Henry W. Lloyd, vicar of Cholsey, and Georgiana Etough, and a brother to F. C. Lloyd (who became vicar of Cholsey, 1890–1895, and later vicar of Kew, Surrey), Arthur was educated at Magdalen School and St Edmund Hall, Oxford.
==Priest==
Ordained a priest by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, on 21 February 1869 at St Luke's Maidenhead, his first post was as his father's curate at Cholsey (1868–1873), his second was curate-in-charge of Watlington, Oxfordshire (1873–1876), from where he moved to become vicar of Aylesbury (1876–1882). After some time as the first vicar of Newcastle upon Tyne after the parish church became Newcastle Cathedral (he was also an honorary canon and rural dean), he was appointed to be vicar of North Creake and Archdeacon of Lynn, becoming also the first modern Bishop of Thetford (suffragan to the Bishop of Norwich) in 1894.
==Bishop==
He was ordained and consecrated a bishop by Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster Abbey, on St Luke's Day (18 October) 1894. In 1903 he was translated (he was nominated on 11 May and installed on 4 June) to become the third Bishop of Newcastle and died in post four years later.
==Death and legacy==
A bachelor who had "always lived" with his sisters, Lloyd died on 29 May 1907 at his sister's house in South Kensington, London. He was buried "as a commoner" on 3 June at St James's parish church, Benwell, where he had lived at Benwell Towers, the bishop's palace; there is, however, an alabaster memorial to him at Newcastle Cathedral. The cathedral memorial was unveiled at a large service on 29 July 1919. On 11 March 2012, Martin Wharton, Bishop of Newcastle, rededicated Lloyd's grave at Benwell, following its restoration after serious neglect.

== References =='Molybdenum cofactor deficiency' is a rare human disease in which the absence of molybdopterin – and consequently its molybdenum complex, commonly called molybdenum cofactor – leads to accumulation of toxic levels of sulphite and neurological damage. Usually this leads to death within months of birth, due to the lack of active sulfite oxidase. Furthermore, a mutational block in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis causes absence of enzyme activity of xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase and aldehyde oxidase.
==Cause==
When caused by a mutation in the MOCS1 gene it is the type A variant.  It can also be caused by a mutation in the MOCS2 gene or the GEPH gene. As of 2010, there had been approximately 132 reported cases.
It should not be confused with molybdenum deficiency.
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of molybdenum cofactor deficiency includes early seizures, low blood levels of uric acid, and high levels of sulphite, xanthine, and uric acid in urine. Additionally, the disease produces characteristic MRI images that can aid in diagnosis.
==Treatment==
Trials of an experimental treatment are going on at several sites in the US.
https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/84057/molybdenum-cofactor-deficiency-type-a-study-alxn1101-neonates-molybdenum/
On 26 February 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved fosdenopterin (Nulibry) for intravenous injection to reduce the risk of death due to Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A. Fosdenopterin replaces the missing cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate  (cPMP).
== Prevalence ==
The prevalence of molybdenum co-factor deficiency is estimated as being between 1 in 100 000 and 1 in 200 000. To date more than 100 cases have been reported. However, this may significantly under represent cases.
== Research ==
In 2009, Monash Children's Hospital at Southern Health in Melbourne, Australia reported that a patient known as Baby Z became the first person to be successfully treated for molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A.  The patient was treated with cPMP, a precursor of molybdopterin. Baby Z will require daily injections of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) for the rest of her life.

==External links=='Montrose School' is an independent school for girls in grades 6-12 located in Medfield, Massachusetts, USA.
==History==
Montrose was founded in 1979 in Brookline, Massachusetts, by a group of parents and educators with a vision of girls’ education inspired by the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and St. Josemaria Escriva. The founders asked the Prelature of Opus Dei to provide chaplains to oversee religious teachings, celebrate mass, hear confessions and lead reflections.
After its initial period in Brookline, the school spent a few years each in the towns of Westwood and Natick. In 2007, Montrose moved to its permanent location in Medfield.
==Curriculum==
Montrose offers a classical liberal arts curriculum, as well as character education integrated throughout the seven-year curriculum. Students participate in a mentoring program, daily enrichment opportunities for mass or non-academic individual reading, a guest speaker series, class and school service projects and the development of habits of heart, mind and character.
The upper school curriculum includes four years of English, mathematics, history, science and theology or philosophy, as well as at least three years of foreign language and fine arts. Languages offered include Spanish, French and Latin. During their senior year, students complete and present final capstone projects focusing on social issues or other interdisciplinary questions.
The middle school curriculum has two English classes in grade 6 and 7 and a full year of geography. In 7th grade, the girls study ancient civilizations. In 8th grade, the girls are introduced to the language program by taking a full year of Latin; they also take civics.
Montrose also offers study abroad trips for students: the "In the Footsteps of Dante" trip to Italy for upper school students. The school has recently introduced an exchange student program for 10 days with one of its sister schools, Rosemont in Ireland.
'Other Activities during School Days'
Girls have at least one study period on almost every day. During one day a week they have an all-school gathering which may consist of a speaker, a game, red and white team competitions, or a Big/Little sister activity.
At the beginning of the year, girls are sorted into either the red or white team, each representing one of the school's colors. These teams compete throughout the year in different activities with a winner announced on the annual themed field day.
The Big/Little sister program pairs one or more upper school (9-12th grade) students and one or more middle school(6-8th grade) students together to have someone to talk to or ask for advice from during the school year. The program is supposed to bond students across grades and create a cohesive environment.
==Extracurricular==
===Sports===
Montrose offers seven varsity sports, plus club sports and other athletic offerings. During fall, soccer, field hockey, volleyball and cross country are offered. Basketball, ski club and indoor track are offered during the winter season, and lacrosse, softball, and track and field club during the spring. Students are encouraged to start a club if they would like to see another sport on the Montrose campus.
'Music and Drama program'
The Montrose Players put on three major productions each year: a middle school musical, an upper school play and an all-school musical. There are also two major music productions annually. These concerts include pieces from The Upper School and Middle School Chorus, Tone Chimes, Instrumental Ensemble and the school's 'a cappella' groups. Montrose School has two 'a cappella' groups, the Treblemakers (upper school) and the Clef Hangers (middle school).
==Sources==2nd Lieutenant Vivian Potter of the New Zealand Army Service Corps wearing campaign medals in 1916
'Vivian Harold Potter' (23 October 1878 – 19 November 1968) was a New Zealand Member of Parliament, miner, trade unionist, and soldier.
==Private life==
Potter was born in Hamilton in 1878, the son of Albert Potter. His mother was Catherine Potter (née Whitehouse), Albert Potter's second wife. Albert Potter left his first wife in 1862 in Hobart when he discovered that both she and Catherine Whitehouse were pregnant with his children; he secretly took four of their five children with them to Auckland. His first wife tracked him down in Mount Eden in 1892.
Vivian Potter mostly lived in Auckland during his early life. He fought in the Second Boer War with the 7th Contingent for about two years; he was a Squadron Quartermaster Sergeant with registration number 4045.
After the Boer War, he married Lillah Coleman at Waihi in January 1904. He was a miner at Waihi and was a member of the Waihi Miners' Union, but opposed the 1912 strike. After the strike was over, he travelled the North Island and lectured on labour arbitration and conciliation.
He was a Second Lieutenant in World War I. He was granted indefinite leave from military service in March 1918 because he suffered from sciatica.
== Political career ==
Potter served on the Waihi Borough Council. He chaired the Waihi school committee for some time, and was on the advisory committee for the Technical School.
Potter represented the Roskill electorate for the Reform Party in the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1919 to 1928. In the , Potter stood in the  electorate for the Reform Party but was beaten by Arthur Stallworthy. In the 1931 election, he was one of five candidates in Eden and came last. In the , he stood in Roskill electorate again, and came fourth of the five candidates.
He died on 19 November 1968 and was buried at Mangere Lawn Cemetery.
==References==The 'TOSCO II process' is an above ground retorting technology for shale oil extraction, which uses fine particles of oil shale that are heated in a rotating kiln. The particularity  of this process is that it use hot ceramic balls for the heat transfer between the retort and a heater. The process was tested in a 40 tonnes per hour test facility near Parachute, Colorado.
==History==
TOSCO II process is a refinement of the Swedish Aspeco process.  The Tosco Corporation purchased its patent rights in 1952. In 1956, the Denver Research Institute performed research and development of this technology, including testing of a 24 ton per day pilot plant, which operated until 1966.  Later the technology development was continued under Tosco's own directions.  In 1964 Tosco, Standard Oil of Ohio, and Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company formed Colony Development, a joint venture company to develop the Colony Shale Oil Project and to commercialize the TOSCO II technology. The project was ended in April 1972.
==Technology==
The TOSCO II process is classified as a hot recycled solids technology.  It employs a horizontal rotating kiln-type retort. In this process, oil shale is crushed smaller than  and enters the system through pneumatic lift pipes in which oil shale is elevated by hot gas streams and preheated to about .  After entering into retort, oil shale is mixed with hot ceramic balls with temperature from  to . This increase the oil shale temperature to between  and , in which pyrolysis occurs. In the pyrolysis process, kerogen decomposes to oil shale gas and oil vapors, while the remainder of the oil shale forms spent shale. Vapors are transferred to a condensor (fractionator) for separation into various fractions.  At the kiln passage, the spent shale and the ceramic balls are separated in a perforated rotating separation drum (trommel). The crushed spent shale falls through holes in the trommel, while ceramic balls are transferred to the ball heater. Combustible shale gas is burned in the ball heater to reheat the ceramic balls.
The overall thermal efficiency of TOSCO II process is low because the energy of spent shale is not recovered and much of the produced shale gas is consumed by the process itself. The efficiency could be increased by burning char (carbonaceous residue in the spent shale) instead of shale gas as a fuel of the ball heater. The process' other disadvantages are mechanical complexity and large number of moving parts. Also the lifetime of ceramic balls is limited.  Disposal of spent shale   includes environmental problems because it is very finely crushed and contains carbon residue.

==References==The 'Defensor minor' is a work by Marsilius of Padua written around 1342. The Defensor minor is a restatement and defense of Marsilius's best known work, the 'Defensor pacis'. 
The text discusses civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, the confession, penance, indulgences, the Crusades, pilgrimages, plenitudo potestatis, legislative power, the origin of the sovereignty, wedding, and divorce.
==Civil jurisdiction==
With regard to jurisdiction, Marsilius distinguishes between divine and human laws, the first event which is independent of any human will and on the conduct of man in view of the afterlife, the second which determines the will of the people, endowed with coercive power and not modifiable by any clergyman.
This applies also to the Pope that even with his decrees may waive the law, manifestation of the people's sovereignty. While the beneficiaries of the two laws are identical, its object and purpose are different. The one seeks the good of the soul and the other cares for earthly well-being, with the result that the church is denied the power to make laws, even in the persistent silence of human legislation. The same applies to amendments and changes, which should remain solely with the people. The only thing that is relevant to the clergy is the non-legal rules that affect morality and resolve themselves into simple counsels and take effect with counsellors.
==The clergy==
The task and the main function of the clergy is to teach the sacred texts and preparing souls for the afterlife. The Church has repeatedly stated that for the sinner there is no other system of redemption from sin but confession. Marsilius, in an effort to bring man to God, regardless of any broker, says that confession should be done directly to God and that salvation comes only by true repentance. This anticipates what will be one of the tenets of Protestantism. The necessity of this Sacrament, that is only recommended and not required, is not detected from the Holy Scriptures. Only sincere repentance to the outside of any denominational can give that peace in the soul that is the prelude of eternal salvation.  Absolution from sin belongs only to God and the priest, who may do so, does so only within the Church. 'Sufficit soli Deo confiteri peccata ipsa, videlicet recognoscendo, et de ipsis poenitendo cum proposito talia alterius non committendi.' 
These words can be regarded as harbingers of what will be the principles of the Lutheran Reformation.
 Marsilio does not exclude absolutely confession: he says only that it is useful but not essential,  which it would be if it were a precept, therefore  he also denies the priestly power to inflict penalties.
Only contrition frees from sin, not repentance of any material or spiritual character almost like a compensation for the sin.

==References==' (; meaning 'philosophy of life') was a dominant philosophical movement of German-speaking countries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which had developed out of German Romanticism.  emphasised the meaning, value and purpose of life as the foremost focus of philosophy.
Its central theme was that an understanding of life can only be apprehended by life itself, and from within itself. Drawing on the critiques of epistemology offered by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, notable ideas of the movement have been seen as precursors to both Husserlian phenomenology and Heideggerian existential phenomenology.  criticised both mechanistic and materialist approaches to science and philosophy and as such has also been referred to as the 'German vitalist movement', though its relationship to biological vitalism is questionable. Vitality in this sense is instead understood as part of a biocentric distinction between life-affirming and life-denying principles.
== Overview ==
Inspired by the critique of rationalism in the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, Søren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche,  emerged in 19th-century Germany as a reaction to the rise of positivism and the theoretical focus prominent in much of post-Kantian philosophy. While often rejected by academic philosophers, it had strong repercussions in the arts.
The  movement bore indirect relation to the subjectivist philosophy of vitalism developed by Henri Bergson, which lent importance to immediacy of experience.
Twentieth-century forms of  can be identified with a critical stress on norms and conventions. The Israeli-American historian Nitzan Lebovic identified  with the tight relation between a "corpus of life-concepts" and what the German education system came to see, during the 1920s, as the proper 'Lebenskunde', the ‘teaching of life’ or ‘science of life’—a name that seemed to support the broader philosophical outlook long held by most biologists of the time. In his book Lebovic traces the transformation of the post-Nietzschean  from the radical aesthetics of the Stefan George Circle to Nazi or "biopolitical" rhetoric and politics.
This philosophy pays special attention to 'life' as a whole, which can only be understood from within. The movement can be regarded as a rejection of Kantian abstract philosophy or scientific reductionism of positivism.

*'Neverita lewisii' (previously known as 'Polinices lewisii', 'Lunatia lewisii', 'Euspira lewisii'), common name 'Lewis's moon snail', is a species of large operculated sea snail. It is a predatory marine gastropod in the family Naticidae, the moon snails. Traditionally, this species was assigned to either the genus 'Lunatia', the genus 'Polinices' or the genus 'Euspira'. Recently, it was assigned to the genus 'Neverita' based on molecular data.
This is the largest species in the family.
==Distribution==
'Neverita lewisii' lives in the Eastern Pacific, from British Columbia to northern Baja California, Mexico.
'Lunatia lewisii' is digging into the mud to protect itself.
Apical view of a shell of 'Lunatia lewisii'
== Habitat ==
This snail is found intertidally and at depths of up to , usually ploughing through the substrate looking for prey.
== Description ==
The shell of this species can grow to  across, the largest of the moon snails. It has  an extremely large foot, which when the snail is active, is extended up over the shell and mantle cavity.  Part of the propodium contains a black-tipped siphon which leads water into the mantle cavity.  The cephalic tentacles, located on its head, are usually visible above the propodium.
When the animal retracts its soft parts into the shell, a lot of water is expelled, thus it is possible to close the shell with its tight-fitting operculum.
== Diet ==
'Neverita lewisii' feeds mainly on bivalve molluscs by drilling a hole in the shell with its radula and feeding on the organism's soft flesh.
== Reproduction ==
Like other moon snails, this species lays its eggs in a "sand collar".  The eggs may number in the thousands and hatch into microscopic larvae which feed on plankton until they undergo torsion and metamorphose into the adult stage.

== External links ==is an action video game for the Sega Dreamcast, developed by General Entertainment and published by Sega. It was released on November 27, 1998 as one of the four launch titles available for the Dreamcast in Japan, and would remain exclusive to that territory. The game, based on the popular 'Godzilla' franchise, has players assuming the role of various giant monsters in an attempt to destroy real-life Japanese cities.
A sequel titled 'Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact' was released in Japan the following year.
==Gameplay==
Players control one of five monsters from the 'Godzilla' universe, initially only Godzilla and Mechagodzilla can be selected, the other characters are unlocked by progressing through the game. The game world is composed of five cities, each comprising two stages, except the final city which has three. The object of the game is to proceed to the next stage by destroying everything on the stage within a set time limit, such as buildings and trees. Each character has projectile attacks, the ability to block incoming attacks and the ability to heal themselves.
==Monsters==
*Godzilla (Heisei)
*Mechagodzilla (1974)
*Minilla
*Godzilla (1954)
*Godzilla-USA
*Giant Doctor Serizawa
==Reception==
'Godzilla Generations' received lukewarm reviews from Japanese gaming magazine 'Famitsu' and a very negative response from Western journalists, despite fans showing interest in the game at the 1998 Tokyo Game Show. Computer and Video Games' reviewer Kim Randell described the game as dull and cited issues such as poor controls, a constantly shifting camera and the player character blocking the player's view. Peter Bartholow of GameSpot derided the game as "terrible" and one of the worst games of 1998. Bartholow found it impossible to block incoming attacks due to the creatures' slow gait. He stated that because of this the developers added a healing ability to each creature, allowing players to continue through the game without fear of their character dying, "There's no strategy, no technique. Just the extreme tedium of tromping through cities."
Despite showing interest in a preview, describing the game as looking like "a riot", Jaz Rignall of IGN and his colleagues were less enthusiastic when their first Dreamcast console arrived three months later with three Japanese launch games. He found "while it brought many smiles and jeers, it didn't impress", the gathered journalists quickly lost interest and moved onto another game. In a November 2002 review of 'Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee', GameSpy's David Hodgson described himself as "'still wincing from Godzilla: Generations'". He went on to say the game "seemed to adhere to the loony premise that bizarre camera angles, a monster trudging in extreme slow motion, and the knuckle-gnawingly slow chipping away of scenery was the new  in monstrous fighting action. It wasn't. It was crap".
Japan-GameCharts reported that the game sold approximately 22,870 copies.
==Sequel==
'Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact' cover art
'Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact' was developed by General Entertainment and published by Sega for the Dreamcast on December 23, 1999 exclusively in Japan. The game is split into levels in which Godzilla is stomping forward through a city while he has to shoot enemies. The player can also make Godzilla duck attacks, by holding or tapping the analog pad. In other levels, Godzilla can walk freely and has to fight in one-on-one against Biollante, King Ghidorah, Mothra, the new robot bosses SMG-IInd and MGR-IInd, SpaceGodzilla, the Super X-III which is the game's smallest boss and the last boss, Destoroyah. Godzilla is the only playable character in the game. He can shoot heat rays at his enemies. IGN gave the game 2.5 out of 10 in their review.

*'Hélio Filipe Dias de Sousa' (born 12 August 1969) is a Portuguese retired footballer who played as a central midfielder, and is the current manager of the Bahrain national team.
==Playing career==
Known by his first name in his playing days, Hélio was born in Setúbal and played his entire career with hometown club Vitória Futebol Clube. Being team captain from an early age, he first appeared with the main squad during the 1987–88 season, and went on to experience promotions and relegations alike throughout 18 professional campaigns, being an undisputed starter in ten of those (three in the second division).
Hélio retired at almost 36, after helping Vitória to the 2005 Portuguese Cup in a 2–1 final win against S.L. Benfica, having played 423 league games – club best – and scoring 21 goals. Internationally, he was part of Portugal's squad at the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship, which was won in Saudi Arabia; in 1994, he earned one cap for the full side.
==Coaching career==
After retiring, Sousa moved into management. Beginning with his only professional club, he moved in 2008–09 to S.C. Covilhã, helping it retain its second-tier status.
In August 2010, Hélio took the reins of the national team's under-18s. He was in charge of several youth categories at the Portuguese Football Federation in the following years.
On 29 July 2018, Sousa led the under-19 team to their first-ever UEFA European Championship after a 4–3 extra time defeat of Italy in Seinäjoki. The following March, he replaced Miroslav Soukup at the helm of Bahrain, but was still in charge of the Portuguese under-20s at the 2019 World Cup, which ended in group stage elimination.
On 14 August 2019, Sousa led Bahrain to their first ever regional title after defeating Iraq 1–0 in the WAFF Championship. On 8 December, he was also on the bench as the team won their first Arabian Gulf Cup, 1–0 against Saudi Arabia.

*'Redirect' to Godzilla video games, currently the article contains virtually nothing more than a fully formatted list entry would provide, and is in good company with the majority of the older Godzilla games in a very poor state.

==References=='Nassarius graniferus', common name the 'granulated dog whelk' or 'granulated nassa', is a species of sea snail with an operculum, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Nassariidae, the mud snails or dog whelks.
==Description==
The length of the shell of this species varies between 10 mm and 18 mm.
The shell is rather small, ovate, thick and globular. Its color is of an ash-white. The spire is  conical and, pointed, composed of six whorls, the lowest much larger than all the other. This body whorl presents on its surface conical, distant tubercles, disposed in four series. A few transverse striae ornament the base. The upper whorls have only a single row of tubercles. The ovate aperture is narrow, emarginated at the upper part, at its union with the outer lip, which is thick, striated internally. The columella is arcuated, covering the inner lip, which is expanded into a white, thick callosity, covering the whole lower surface, and a portion of the upper whorls.
==Distribution==
The shell occurs in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean off Réunion, Aldabra, Chagos, Mascarene Basin. Specimens of this species were gathered by Rizal in Dapitan in 1894 although he labeled them as 'Nassa arcularia'; also off many islands in Oceania and off Australia (New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland).

*'Operation Benin', also known as 'Operation Cotonou', was a rescue mission carried out by the Lebanese Navy SEALs Regiment in Cotonou, Benin between December 26, 2003 and December 30, 2003 This operation is considered to be the first mission carried out by Lebanese Armed Forces units abroad. Its task was to recover bodies and two black boxes from UTA Flight 141.
==Background==
A UTA Boeing 727-223 heading to Beirut carrying 161 people, mainly Lebanese going to spend the New Year vacation in Lebanon, crashed into the sea shortly after take off resulting in 139 dead  on December 25, 2003. The crash is considered to be the worst accident in the Lebanese aviation history as per the number of Lebanese citizens affected. The plane was a private jet operated by a Libyan businessman, who was amongst the few survivors.
==Mission Details==
===Receiving Orders===
At 12:20 a.m., night of December 25–26, 2003, commander of the Lebanese Navy SEALs Regiment General George Chraim receives a call from the Lebanese Armed Forces commander-in-chief General Michel Suleiman ordering him to prepare a Navy SEALs unit to be fully equipped and immediately dispatched to Beirut International Airport, and then fly for a rescuing and bodies recovering mission in Benin, that's in addition to locating the two black boxes.
===Getting Ready===
According to Colonel Chraim, some soldiers were called after from their homes; in addition, getting the diving gears and equipment, and boats ready was done within a very short time, as the unit was ready at 2:10 a.m. in the airport, and then boarded an MEA airliner that took off at 2:30 a.m.
===Arrival at Cotonou===
The plane reached Cadjehoun Airport at 10 a.m, a French military attache officer and another Beninese were waiting the team in order to guide them through and cooperate on their needs. For the next step the team had to take vehicles prepared by the local Lebanese community to reach the crash scene and start surveying it.
===Operations===
Upon arrival to the crash site, the team started clearing the people off the area, and started preparing the gears and equipment. The team then started diving under the plane remains in the water which was mixed up with jet fuel. Shortly after, they started pulling the wreckage to the shore using the available vehicles. The first day ended at 6:00 p.m. as the sunset began. At the morning of the second day, the team returned to the crash site, and divided into two groups:
 
* First one equipped with two Rigid-hulled inflatable boats, their goal was to scan the surface of the water as far as 10 kilometers into the sea, and to pull out bodies and bring them to shore
* Second group, composed of 7 divers, 3 of which were French, their goal was to dive as deep as 600 meters scanning for bodies and the two black boxes.
At around 1 O'clock the second team was able to find the first black box, later that day, the other box was found. Searching and rescuing continued later that night.
On the third day, a meeting with the officials from Benin, Lebanon, and France was held at the airport to discuss and assess the situation, and concluded that it was time to return to Lebanon.
===Returning to Lebanon===
At 1:10 p.m. of the third day, a plane carrying the team and Lebanese officials, in addition to the bodies of the victims took off to Lebanon, and arrived to Beirut International Airport at around 9 p.m. The team directly left the airport to their base to present a report about the mission.
==The team==
The rescue team included ten members:
# Colonel George Chraim, commander of the Lebanese Navy SEALs regiment.
# Captain Fadi Makhoul
# Captain Haidar Skini
# Captain Fadi Kfoury
# First Class Sergeant Mohamed Mrad 
# First Class Sergeant Simon Makhlouf

*'Delete or transwiki to Wiktionary'. Although the phrase does appear to have been used by parent support organisations prior to the publication of the book (eg ), it has no added meaning beyond the usual metaphorical application of 'roller coaster' with 'NICU', and so there is little potential for the development of an article. It might be suitable for Wiktionary, I'm not sure of their inclusion criteria. The book of this title was published in 2008, and I've found no evidence to suggest it is notable, as yet.

*Actually doctors and nurses do use the term "NICU Rollercoaster" when talking to parents in the NICU.  It helps explain why one day the baby seems to be doing well and the next day takes a huge turn for the worse.  It tends to happen in a pattern and tends to happen repeatedly in the first few weeks or months or life.  With the huge increase in preemie births in this country, the term seems to come up more and more.

No further edits should be made to this page.'James Bisset' (ca. 1762 – 17 August 1832) was a Scottish-born artist, manufacturer, writer, collector, art dealer and poet, who spent most of his life in and around Birmingham, England.
Bisset was born in Perth, the son of a merchant who invested the Baltic flax trade but had fallen upon hard times. He was educated at Perth Academy until 1776 when he moved at the age of 13 to Birmingham, where his brother had established himself as a merchant. At the age of 15 Bisset obtained an apprenticeship with a Birmingham japanner, and by 1785 was listed in a local trade directory as a painter of miniatures. His invention of a method of painting on the inside of convex glasses enabled him to develop a successful business making ornamental goods and marry the daughter of a local landowner, and the early years of the nineteenth century saw him diversifying into medal-production and art dealing.
In 1808 Bisset moved to a large house in New Street where he established a museum and picture gallery – Birmingham's first – that displayed everything from paintings and medals to stuffed wildlife and "works of savage nations", and was visited by both Sir William Hamilton, the greatest collector of his day, and Horatio Nelson. In 1813 he sold two paintings by Canaletto and moved to nearby Leamington Spa, where his museum was re-established by his wife Dolly.
Frontispiece to 'A poetic survey round Birmingham' (1800)
Bisset was a notable figure in Birmingham's cultural and commercial life, a prominent member of the Birmingham Book Club and a composer of much published verse. His most notable work is his 1800 'Poetic survey round Birmingham, with a brief description of the different curiosities and manufactures of the place, accompanied with a magnificent directory, with the names and professions, &c. superbly engraved in emblematic plates' – a directory of Birmingham trades at the time of the town's revolutionary industrial expansion, written in heroic verse and intended as a "grand tour" of the "works of genius" of a "seat of the arts".
==References=='SV Göppingen' is a German association football club from the city of Göppingen, Baden-Württemberg. The team was established on 13 October 1905 as '1. Göppingener Fuβballverein' and lays claim to being the oldest football club in the city. On 24 April 1920, soon after World War I the club merged with 'Athletiksportverein 1895 Göppingen' and took on its current identity. The origins of predecessor side 'ASV' go back to 11 August 1895 formation of '1. Athletik Klub Göppingen'. This club merged with 'Kraftsportverein Fortuna Göppingen' in 1901 to become 'Athleten-Klub Foruna Göppingen'. They adopted the name 'Athletiksportverein Göppingen' early in 1907, and in 1911 merged with 'Sportclub Göppingen'.
__TOC__
==History==
'SV' first came to notice in 1934 when they became part of the Gauliga Württemberg, one of 16 top-flight divisions created in the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich a year earlier. The club only spent the 1934–35 and 1936–37 seasons in first division play, being sent down on both occasions after 10th-place finishes. They returned to the Gauliga in 1943, captured the division title, and then went out in the opening round of the national playoffs to 'KSG Saarbrücken' (3:5). The following season was that last before World War II interrupted play across the country.
After the war, 'Göppingen' took up play in the Landesliga Württemberg (II), but was sent down in 1948 after just three seasons. It was not until 1968 that they returned to third tier competition in the Amateurliga Nordwürttemberg. They finished second and the next year took the division title, which led to their participation in the national amateur championship playoffs. 'SV' moved on to the semifinals where they were eliminated 1:0, 2:1 by 'SC Jülich 1910'.
In league play, a successful promotion playoff advanced 'SV' to the Regionalliga Süd (II) where they found themselves overmatched. They returned to the Amateurliga Nordwürttemberg (III) which later (1980) became the Amateuroberliga Baden-Württemberg (III). They enjoyed a string of strong finishes through the late 70s before slipping away to lower tier local play in the mid-80s. It was during this period that they made appearances in the opening rounds of the German Cup tournament (1975, 1980, 1984). 'SV' played first in the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg (III) until 1985, then in the Verbandsliga Württemberg (IV) until 1991 and then descended through the Landesliga Württemberg (V) to the Bezirksliga (VI) in 1994. Since 2007, 'SV' have played in the Landesliga Württemberg (VI), from where they earned promotion back to the Verbandsliga in 2009. In 2013–14 and 2014–15 the club finished runners-up in the league and thereby earned the right to compete in the promotion round to the Oberliga. In 2014 it missed out to FC Germania Friedrichstal and, in 2015, to 1. CfR Pforzheim, thereby remaining in the Verbandsliga. Finishing runners-up in the league for a third consecutive time in 2015–16 the club took part in the promotion round once more, this time defeating TSG Weinheim on aggregate and moving up to the Oberliga, ending a 31-year absence for the club.

It stands for the proposition that a display of goods can be an offer and a whole offer, rather than an invitation to treat, and serves as an example for how onerous exclusion clauses can be deemed to not be incorporated in a contract.
==Facts==
David Chapelton went to a beach with his friend, Miss Andrews, at Cold Knap, a district of Barry in south Wales. There was a pile of deckchairs. A notice next to them said,
"Barry Urban District Council. Cold Knap. Hire of chairs 2d. per session of 3 hours."
It also said tickets should be obtained from attendants. Mr Chapelton took two chairs from an attendant, paid the money and received two tickets. He put them in his pocket. On the tickets was written,
"Available for three hours. Time expires where indicated by cut-off and should be retained and shown on request. The council will not be liable for any accident or damage arising from the hire of the chair."
When Mr Chapelton sat on the chair it gave way, the canvas tearing from the top of the chair. He was injured. The County Court judge held the council would have been negligent but that liability was exempted by the ticket. Mr Chapelton appealed.
==Judgment==
The Court of Appeal upheld Mr Chapelton's claim, overturning the judgment at first instance; it held that there was a valid offer when the chairs were on display, accepted when picked up the chairs from the defendant. Therefore, the ticket was merely a receipt of the contract, and the exclusion clause could not be incorporated as a term, because it was too late. Slesser LJ read the facts and gave his judgment first.

'Pseudomelatomidae' is a family of predatory sea snails, marine gastropods included in the superfamily Conoidea (previously Conacea) and part of the Neogastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005).
In 1995 Kantor elevated the subfamily Pseudomelatominae to the status of family Pseudomelatomidae. 
In 2011 Bouchet, Kantor 'et al'. moved the Crassispirinae and Zonulispirinae and numerous genera of snails loosely called turrid snails (which at that point had been placed in the family Conidae) and placed them in the family Pseudomelatomidae.  This was based on a cladistical analysis of shell morphology, radular characteristics, anatomical characters, and a dataset of molecular sequences of three gene fragments.

==Overview==
It is spoken in the northeast of Nok in Jaba Local Government Area (LGA), Kaduna State. The speakers prefer to spell the name of their language as 'Kyoli', which is pronounced  kjoli or çjoli. The ethnic group is referred to as 'Kwoli'.
There are about 7,000-8,000 Kyoli speakers living in the two village clusters of Hal-Kyoli and Bobang. Bobang is the cultural center of the Kyoli-speaking area. Bobang village cluster consists of the five hamlets of Bobang, Fadek, Akoli, Hagong, and Nyamten. Hal-Kyoli village is situated by itself. All of the Kwoli villages surround the foot of Egu-Kyoli Hill, which rises more than 240 meters above the villages.
==Tone==
Cori is known for having six distinct levels of tone, too many to transcribe using the International Phonetic Alphabet, which allows five. However, there are only three underlying tones: 1 (), 4 (), and 6 (), which are all that need to be written for literacy. Most cases of Tone 2 () are a result of tone sandhi, with 4 becoming 2 before 1. Tones 3 () and 5 () can be analysed as contour tones, with underlying  realised as  and  realised as .
In order to transcribe the surface tones without numerals (which are ambiguous), an extra diacritic is needed, as is common for four-level languages in Central America:  
:'1'  ()
:2  ()
:3  ()
:'4'  ()
:5  ()
:'6'  ()

St George Wharf
'St George Wharf' is a riverside development in Vauxhall, Lambeth, London, England, located on the southern bank of the River Thames beside Vauxhall Bridge. 'St George Wharf Pier' is a calling point for London River Services riverboat RB2 and RB6 services.
The  mixed-use development is located between the Vauxhall Cross road junction and the river, and is near Vauxhall station. The River Effra, one of the Thames' many underground tributaries, empties into the river close by. This development should not be confused with the smaller St George's Wharf which is in Shad Thames, London SE1, close to Tower Bridge.
==Construction==
Construction of St George Wharf was carried out in phases by developers St George, part of Berkeley Group Holdings, with blocks opening between 2001 and 2010. St George Wharf Tower was the final block to be completed, opening in 2012. The development comprises over 1,400 apartments, as well as offices, retail units and restaurants. It was designed by the architecture practice Broadway Malyan.
St George Wharf comprises the following blocks:
# Admiral House
# Anchor House
# Aquarius House
# Armada House
# Bridge House (18 St George Wharf, SW8 2LP/Q)
# Drake House
# Ensign House (12 St George Wharf, SW8 2LU)
# Flagstaff House
# Fountain House
# Galleon House
# Hamilton House
# Hanover House (7 St George Wharf, SW8 2JA)
# Hobart House
# Jellicoe House
# Kestrel House
# Kingfisher House
# Sentinel Point
# The Tower
St George Wharf Tower is a residential skyscraper. It is  tall with 49 storeys. It is cited as the tallest residential building in the United Kingdom, however there are 10 apartments within The Shard, which is taller. Two residential towers currently under construction in London, Newfoundland Quay and Landmark Pinnacle will be taller than the Tower when completed in 2020.
==Helicopter crash==
At 07:57 GMT on 16 January 2013, a helicopter collided with a crane being used in the construction of the St George Wharf Tower.  The helicopter crashed in nearby Wandsworth Road, killing the pilot. One person on the ground also died, and a number of others were injured.
==Carbuncle Cup==
In October 2006, St George Wharf was nominated and made the 'Building Design' shortlist for the inaugural Carbuncle Cup, which was ultimately awarded to Drake Circus Shopping Centre in Plymouth.

Its most popular products included Polident denture cleanser, Poli-Grip denture adhesive, Dentu-Creme denture toothpaste, Nytol sleeping pill, Tegrin medicated shampoo for psoriasis, Lava hand soaps (acquired from Procter & Gamble), Beano and Phazyme anti-gas products, Balmex diaper rash ointments, and Sensodyne desensitizing toothpaste.
GlaxoSmithKline purchased the company for $1.24 billion in 2001.
== History ==
The company was founded in 1907 by Alexander Block, a Russian immigrant who had a small drugstore on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, New York. He turned the company into a wholesaler in 1915, then became a drug manufacturer in 1925, acquiring a 50 percent interest in Wernet's Dental Manufacturing Company.
Block Drug moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey in 1938.
Although Alexander Block built the company largely through acquisitions, he developed the Polident brand internally during the 1930s.  In 1948, Block Drug rolled out the Ammi-i-Dent tooth powder, and in the early 1950s, the company developed Nytol.  After Alexander Block's death in 1953, his son Leonard N. Block (1911–2005) took over, eventually becoming the company's chairman.  The last major new product the company introduced was Tegrin, in 1964.
===Timeline===
*'1971' – The company went public, trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol BLOCA and raising $5.2 million in its initial offering.  Two years later, another stock sale generated $23 million.  Later in the 1970s, Efferdent took over from Polident as the No. 1 brand in its space.
*'1972' – Block named as its president James Block, who was the grandson of Alexander Block and the nephew of Leonard N. Block.  In 1988, James became chairman as his uncle, Leonard N. Block became senior chairman.  At the same time, Leonard N. Block's son, Thomas, became the company's president.
*'1978' – Block Drug entered the feminine hygiene market, with the ultimately unsuccessful Gentle Spring brand.
*'1983' – The company acquired Passaic, New Jersey-based 2000 Flushes toilet bowl cleaner manufacturer Flushco.  In 1985, Block Drug acquired the X-14 line of hard surface cleaners from White Laboratories. Block Drug later acquired Gold Bond in 1987.
*'1990s'  –  Sales began to fall as Block Drug's products began to age and face new competition, and the problem was exacerbated by a lack of new products.
*'1990' – Block Drug sold Gold Bond to Martin Himmel Inc..
*'1992' – The company acquired Phazyme from Reed and Carnrick.
*'1995' – Block Drug divested its U.S. Reed and Carnrick Pharmaceuticals Division to Schwarz Pharma KermersUrban and also purchased Reckitt and Colman's Carpet Fresh and Rug Fresh cleaning and deodorizing products.  
*'Late 1995' – The company acquired the Lava soap brand from Procter & Gamble.
*'1996' – Block Drug purchased the Baby's Own line of baby care products, and then acquired Beano antigas tablets in 1997.
*'1998' – A major restructuring took place but was not successful.  As part of that, the company divested Carpet Fresh, Rug Fresh, 2000 Flushes and X-14. Lava was later sold to WD-40 Company the following year.
*'1999' – The company acquired Salisbury, N.C.-based Stanback Co., manufacturer of Stanback headache powder products.
*'2000' – Block Drug hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser to evaluate a potential sale. 
*'2001' – At the time of its sale to Glaxo, Block Drug was reported to have $900 million in annual sales, operations in 100 countries and employed 3,000 people.
=== Secrecy ===
Although Block Drug was a public company from 1971 until 2001, it operated much like a private, family-run firm, with the Block family holding all voting shares plus 54 percent of the non-voting stock.  In addition, the company never held annual meetings or issued proxy statements.
== Aftermath ==
Leonard N. Block died in 2005 at age 93 after suffering for years from Alzheimer's disease.
Block's nephew John P. Roberts was the producer of the Woodstock Festival using money from his Block inheritance.
==References=='Simulation Open Framework Architecture' ('SOFA') is an open source framework primarily targeted at real-time physical simulation, with an emphasis on 'medical simulation'. 
It is mostly intended for the research community to help develop newer algorithms, but can also be used as an efficient prototyping tool or as a physics engine.
==Features==
Based on an advanced software architecture, SOFA allows users to:
* Create 'complex and evolving simulations' by combining new algorithms with existing algorithms
* Modify most parameters of the simulation (deformable behavior, surface representation, solver, constraints, collision algorithm, ...) by simply editing a XML file
* Build complex models from simpler ones using a scene graph description
* Efficiently simulate the dynamics of interacting objects using 'abstract equation solvers'
* Reuse and easily compare a variety of available methods
* Transparently 'parallelize' complex computations using semantics based on data dependencies
* Use new generations of GPUs through the CUDA API to greatly improve computation times
===Scene graph===
A key aspect of SOFA is the use of a scene graph to organize and process the elements of a simulation while clearly separating the computation tasks from their possibly parallel scheduling. The description of a SOFA simulation can easily be done in an 'XML file'. For even more flexibility, a Python plugin allows scripting simulations using the Python language. 
Basically, a SOFA scene-graph is composed with:
* 'Nodes': used to categorise the components and keep the XML file clean (mechanical node, collision node, visual node, ...)
* 'Components': main elements used to build a scene (solver component, forcefield component, rendering component, ...)
* 'Datas': everything that components have to deal with (forces, velocities, positions, ratios, ...)
===Plugins===
To extend its capacities and provide more features, SOFA is bundled with a lot of plugins:
* Drivers for VR / 'haptic' / simulation devices (Geomagic®, ARTTrack™, Novint® Falcon™…)
* Visualization and simulation of medical images
* Python scripting
* Parallelization:
** Multithreading
** GPU computing using the 'CUDA' API
==Community==
===SOFA Day===
Organized each year, the SOFA Day is a one-day event dedicated to SOFA. This event is 'open to everyone' interested in SOFA, from beginner to advanced users. It contains an introduction to SOFA, several tutorials (adapted to the audience) and a large time to experience SOFA with the help of the instructors.
===SOFA Consortium===
Exactly ten years after the first commit in SOFA, Inria founded the SOFA Consortium in December 2015. 
The Consortium missions are to:
* Represent the 'identity of SOFA'
* Organize and develop the 'community'
* Distribute and make SOFA more 'stable'

Born in Romford, England, but raised in Hong Kong, Soo is currently residing in Canada and was formally trained as an engineer.
==Webcomics==
Soo drew comics on-and-off in school, and began taking his hobby more seriously when he attended university, where he drew several short stories and comic strips.  Soo started posting webcomics in Q3 2002, as an affordable alternative to printing minicomics. Soo was inspired by figures such as Patrick Farley, Kazu Kibuishi, Derek Kirk Kim, Jason Turner, and the people behind Pants Press. One of Soo's first longer webcomics was 'Elsewhere', which he drew on 24 Hour Comic Day.
Soo experimented much with the use of sound and music in webcomics in the early 2000s. He embedded MP3-files on the pages of his short webcomics such as 'Devil in the Kitchen', 'Bottle Up and Explode!', and 'Passing Afternoon'. Soo found that different readers read the webcomics at different rates, which made it difficult sync up the images with the audio. However, he was not interested in using Adobe Flash to direct the user's experience, fearing that the webcomic would turn into a "musical slideshow." Instead, Soo sometimes used lyrics to pace the reader's experience, such as to ensure that readers would reach emotional climax of 'Bottle Up and Explode!' just as the instrumental section of its accompanying song kicked in. Other times, such as for 'Snowstorm', the accompanying song is purely intended to convey and enhance the mood of the scene.
==Career==
In 2004, Soo became interested in working on a long-form project, and doodles of the "girl hugging a grub-like monster" Jellaby in his sketchbook caught his eye. Soo met Hope Larson, who had just moved to Toronto at the time, and he realized that his story idea was similar to that of Larson's 'Salamander Dream', which he had been reading online. Both he and Larson were interested in getting graphic novels published, so the two decided to launch a website to act as a venue to try to sell books to a publisher. The two created the website Secret Friend Society at the start of 2005, and about a year later Disney Press emailed him about their interest in publishing 'Jellaby'. The first issue of 'Jellaby' was eventually published by Disney's Hyperion in 2008.
Soo has had many collaborations and contributing works published.  His work has been featured in the comic anthology 'Flight', and has acted as the anthology's assistant editor since Volume 2.  He has also worked as an assistant on the children's graphic novel series 'Amulet', by Kazu Kibuishi.

The 'Bambouseraie de Prafrance' (34 hectares, 84 acres) is a private botanical garden specializing in bamboos, located in Générargues, near Anduze, Gard, Languedoc-Roussillon, France. It is open daily in the warmer months; an admission fee is charged.
The garden contains one of Europe's oldest bamboo collections, established in 1856 by amateur botanist Eugène Mazel (1828-1890), who had made his fortune in the spice trade, and who continued to build the collection until he encountered financial problems in 1890. Although the garden subsequently changed ownership several times, it has continued to be a showcase for bamboos, and today contains around 300 bamboo species and cultivars, as well as other plantings of Asiatic shrubs and trees, 'Ginkgo biloba', sequoia, 'Trachycarpus fortunei', a replica of a Laotian village, and some 5 km of water canals.

He is the executive editor of  the 'Asbury Park Press', and creator of DataUniverse.com, a public records site used by multiple Gannett newspapers.
==Education==
D'Ambrosio graduated from The George Washington University. In 2018, he received an M.A. in journalism and strategic communications from the University of Memphis.
==Career==
===Journalism===
In October 1981, D'Ambrosio joined the 'Asbury Park Press' as a reporter responsible for covering Jackson Township, New Jersey. He was later promoted to an investigations editor, senior regional news strategist, and director of investigations and news director for the newspaper before becoming the executive editor in 2019.
D'Ambrosio works in a field of journalism called computer-assisted reporting, which uses various programs to analyze government data.

:'The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the debate.  'Please do not modify it.' Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a deletion review). No further edits should be made to this page.'Incontinence' ("a want of continence or self-restraint") is often used by philosophers to translate the Greek term Akrasia (ἀκρασία). Used to refer to a lacking in moderation or self-control, especially related to sexual desire, incontinence may also be called 'wantonness'.
==Aristotle==
Aristotle devoted book VII of the Nicomachean Ethics to the discussion of continence and incontinence, having previously linked the latter both to prodigality in its effects, and to those dominated by irrational feeling in its failure to obey knowledge of the good: a case of knowing virtue, but not having habituated it to control passion. 
Aristotle considered one could be incontinent with respect to money or temper or glory, but that its core relation was to bodily enjoyment. Its causes could be weakness of will, or an impetuous refusal to think. At the same time, he did not consider it a vice, because it is not so much a product of moral choice, but instead, a failure to act on one's better knowledge.
==Later developments==
For Augustine, incontinence was not so much a problem of knowledge (knowing but not acting) but of the will: he considered it a matter of everyday experience that men incontinently choose lesser over greater goods.
In the structural division of Dante's 'Inferno', incontinence is the sin punished in the second through fifth circles. The mutual incontinence of lust was for Dante the lightest of the deadly sins, even if its lack of self-control would open the road to deeper layers of Hell.
Akrasia appeared later as a character in Spenser's The Faerie Queene, representing the incontinence of lust, followed in the next canto by a study of that of anger; and as late as Jane Austen the sensibility of such figures as Marianne Dashwood would be treated as a form of (spiritual) incontinence.
With the triumph of Romanticism, however, the incontinent choice of feeling over reason became increasingly valorised in Western culture. Blake wrote that "those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained". Encouraged by Rousseau, there was a rise of what Arnold J. Toynbee would describe as "an 'abandon' (ακρατεια)...a state of mind in which antinomianism is accepted – consciously or unconsciously, in theory or in practice – as a substitute for creativeness".
A peak of such acrasia was perhaps reached in the 1960s cult of letting it all hang out – of breakdown, acting out and emotional self-indulgence and drama. Partly in reaction, the proponents of emotional intelligence would look back to Aristotle in the search for impulse control and delayed gratification – to his dictum that "a person is called continent or incontinent according as his reason is or is not in control".

Cyprus has an embassy in Athens and a consulate-general in Thessaloniki. Greece has an embassy in Nicosia. Both countries are full members of the European Union, Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Relations between the two countries have been exceptionally close since antiquity. The Greek Cypriot majority in Cyprus and the ethnic Greek population of Greece share a common ethnicity, heritage, language, and religion, leading to an exceptionally close relationship between the two countries. Traditionally, Greece has been the major export and import partner of Cyprus.

==Biography==
After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Roberts and his friend Joel Rosenman tried to pitch a story for a television series about entrepreneurs who had more money than ideas.  Each week their antics would get them into a new series of problems.
Roberts and Rosenman had met at a golf course in 1966 and shared an apartment in 1967.
To do research they placed an advertisement in 'The Wall Street Journal' identifying themselves as "young men with unlimited capital" who were looking for business ideas.  Among the 5,000 responding were Michael Lang and Artie Kornfeld who proposed building a recording studio in Woodstock, New York to encourage recordings by local residents Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and The Band. Eventually this idea was dropped in favor of staging an outdoor music festival.
As they developed a plan, once it became clear there was no area around Woodstock that would meet their requirements, they moved the proposed location to Wallkill, New York.  But protests from local residents prompted another move in turn to its eventual site in Bethel, New York.
The concert cost between $2.4 million and $3.1 million to produce and brought in $1.8 million from gate receipts.  While the producers would make money on the movie and soundtrack of the events, Roberts said he did not get out of debt from the event until 1980.
After the concert they produced subsequent events of the same type and operated a leveraged buyout firm in Manhattan.
Roberts, living in Manhattan, died of cancer on October 27, 2001, at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 56 years old. Roberts was Jewish.
==Portrayals==
In the 2009 film 'Taking Woodstock' he is portrayed by Skylar Astin.

Wickwire was born in Nebraska but was raised in rural Colorado where he received a religious upbringing as a Seventh-day Adventist. He received his B.A. from Union College in Lincoln, Neb. During the 1940s he earned the first of two degrees (B.D and Ph.D) from the Yale Divinity School. While at Yale, he contracted poliomyelitis, which resulted in a thirteen-month stay in a local pauper's hospital; "an experience which he credited as providing him with a broader perspective on the world."  Despite his need for crutches afterwards, "Chet the Jet" earned his moniker with his boundless energy. He was ordained in the United Church of Christ. He was married to Mary Ann Wickwire for 71 years until his death. Dr. Wickwire was also an avid poet with two published collections.
His memorial service was attended by numerous community leaders and former U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes. Sen. Barbara Mikulski wrote a remembrance for the occasion.
==Activities at the Johns Hopkins University==
In 1953, after graduating from the Yale Divinity School, Dr. Wickwire was hired as the Executive Secretary of the Levering Hall YMCA, located at the Johns Hopkins University. He later became the University chaplain until his retirement in 1984. He became involved in activities both on campus and in Baltimore. In 1958 he started the Tutorial Project, in which Hopkins students volunteered to help tutor Baltimore's underprivileged, largely black urban youth. This community program is still in operation. The University created the Chester Wickwire Diversity Award to honor an "undergraduate student of any race or ethnic background who promotes multicultural harmony on the Homewood Campus."
==Civil rights endeavors==
Dr. Wickwire organized the first integrated concert to happen in Baltimore. It was held in 1959 at the 5th regiment armory and included Maynard Ferguson and Dave Brubeck. He worked with Baltimore's community leaders, including Walter P. Carter, and ministers in the 1960s to integrate Gwynn Oak Amusement Park. Through his work with community organizations, Dr. Wickwire came to occupy a place of high respect amongst community leaders. Upon the death of its president, Rev. Wickwire was elected the first and only white leader of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, an organization of mostly African-American ministers in Baltimore. In the spring of 1970, when police were searching for members of the Baltimore Black Panthers, they agreed to surrender only to Dr. Wickwire. He was at one time the chairman of the Maryland Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.
==Peace and labor activism==
He was often at odds with the Johns Hopkins University administration as he pursued peace initiatives. He regularly invited speakers such as Philip Berrigan to speak on campus. In 1962, he was detained in Moscow along with Johns Hopkins exchange students for allegedly distributing anti-Soviet literature. He supported a labor boycott of J.P. Stevens & Co. for its anti-union actions in 1977 as co-chairman of a citizens committee. He pushed for better rights and conditions in 1982 for migrant workers in Maryland as chairman of a panel advising the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Later, with the same panel, he worked to improve rights of Korean-American storeowners. During the 1990s, Dr. Wickwire made a series of trips to Central America to oppose political oppression as member of Ecumenical Program in Central America (EPICA). For his work, his was given an honorary doctorate from the University of El Salvador.

Non-notable newspaper.  Suggest delete and merge with Bohol town article. Oscarthecat (talk) 22:25, 29 November 2008 (UTC)

*'Keep'. A  Google Books search shows clear notability, with  this book having a sixteen-page chapter about the subject. I'd also point out a couple of flaws with the nomination: firstly it suggests merging, not deletion, so shouldn't really be at AfD at all, and secondly Bohol is not a town, but a province with a population of over a million. Would anyone suggest that articles on every institution or business in Montana, which has a smaller population, should be merged with the article on the state? Of course not, and this proposal is equivalent to that. Phil Bridger (talk) 22:36, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

== Life ==
Perlow was born in New York City in 1916, and attended Townsend Harris Hall. At 16, he went to study medicine at Cornell University. However, he later switched to physics, as he said his talents did not lie in medicine. He obtained his bachelor's degree in 1936 at Cornell University. His graduate thesis 'On measurements of Lα satellite x rays' was supervised by Floyd K. Richtmyer. He obtained his Ph.D from University of Chicago in 1940, where researched nuclear reactions of lithium-6. There he met his wife Mina Rea Jones, a chemist, when looking for assistance in building lithium targets.
After his Ph.D thesis, he left Chicago to work for the Naval Ordnance Laboratory and the US Naval Research Laboratory, on the detection of submarine using ultrasounds as part of the war effort. After the war, he used and modified captured V-2 rockets to make measurements on atmospheric cosmic rays, leading him to propose that most gamma rays in the atmosphere were not the cosmic rays themselves, but were rather due to Compton backscattering.
In 1952, he became a faculty member at University of Minnesota. In 1954, he moved to Illinois to work at the Argonne National Laboratory, until he retired in 1981. In 1970, he became editor of the Journal of Applied Physics and Applied Physics Letters.
In the words of John Schiffer and Charles Johnson, Perlow was a "...witty and cultured man, he enjoyed reading, sketching, listening to music, and sailing his yacht on Lake Michigan."
==Work==
Other than his work on cosmic rays, and on the Mössbauer effect, Perlow worked on the hyperfine structure of iron-57 and other properties of iron atoms, such as their internal magnetic field.

NN concentration camp guard. He has an article as it is alleged that he won a throat-cutting competition one Saturday night at Jasenovac concentration camp. No sources have been provided to support this in the time since this article was last AfD'd. The first question is whether winning such a competition makes you noteworthy or not. The general lack of reliable sources (about whether the competition took place, or whether Bržica won it) makes the article, in my view, deleteworthy.

*'Keep' - but good question is about category and editorial style. We are having person called 'Speedy Peter' (english translation of his name) about which 'nobody' is knowing year or birth or death. Organization of 'unknown name' has put him on the list of 59 Nazis in USA. In the end Speedy Peter is winner of killing competion and has killed between 670 and 1360 person in 'unknown time period'. Last problem is in only english language source (The Glass Half Full) which is speaking about this killing because it is false. This source is clearly saying that Speedy Peter has "'boasted' that during one night alone he killed 1,360 prisoners". Source is not saying that he has killed (why all others sources are having quotations and this not ? editor POV pushing ?). Sources 3 and 7 are not wiki OK because of wikipedia reliable source rules.

As such, it has a mission to seek the proper allocation of resources and public funds and contribute to the modernization of the state, by means of continuous improvement in the various public entities. It is one of the Colombian Control Institutions along with the Office of the Inspector General of Colombia.
==History==
In 1923, after several years of financial crisis, President Pedro Nel Ospina requested an expert committee to study Colombian economic conditions. This committee, led by American economist Edwin Walter Kemmerer (known as 'The Money Doctor') was called the Kemmerer Mission. Kemmerer had already worked with Latin American governments; that of Mexico in 1917 and of Guatemala in 1919. 
President Pedro Nel Ospina approved Law 42 which created the Office of the Comptroller General
Up until then the Court of Auditors () was the accountability agency of the nation, it was an agency of judicial and fiscal nature, but it was part of the Executive Branch. A study led by the Kemmerer Mission, with the assistance of the Colombian Finance Minister Esteban Jaramillo, recommended Congress to create the Bank of the Republic, and the Office of the Comptroller General, and to structure the laws for this function using those already existing. The Kemmerer Mission recommended the creation of the Office of the Comptroller General after considering that it could establish the necessary means for imposing a strict observance of the laws and administrative norms in the management of resources and public funds.
Government introduced new legislation in Congress following the recommendations of the Kemmerer Mission. ' Law 42 of 1923' was passed by Congress, being signed by the President of the Senate Luis de Greiff, and the President of the Chamber of Representatives Ignacio Moreno. The new law was approved and signed by President Nel Ospina and his Minister of Finance Gabriel Posada, and finally ratified by Congress on July 19, 1923.
The Office of the Comptroller General began functioning on September 1, 1923, when Law 42 took effect. The first Comptroller General of the Republic was Eugenio Andrade, who was appointed by President Ospina. The current Comptroller General is Carlos Felipe Córdoba Larrarte.

It operates D.O.D, scheduled and charter airline cargo within Alaska, Canada, Mexico and continental US Its Maintenance base is Fairbanks International Airport with its major cargo hub at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.  The company slogan is 'Legendary Aircraft. Extraordinary Service.'

== Fleet ==
As of July 2016, the active Everts Air Cargo fleet includes eighteen aircraft:
* 11 Douglas DC-6
* 2 Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando (cargo only)
* 3 Douglas DC-9 (cargo only)
* 2 McDonnell Douglas MD-80 (cargo only)
A further twelve aircraft (two DC-9, two MD-80, seven DC-6 and one C-46) are inactive or in storage.
==Operating the Douglas DC-6==
Everts Air Cargo DC-6 lifting off at Anchorage
Since Northern Air Cargo abandoned their regular service with the Douglas DC-6, Everts Air Cargo is the last airline in the USA to operate scheduled flights with a rather large fleet of 60-year-old piston-powered aircraft. In a 2007 video interview, the Anchorage Station Manager stated that the DC-6 was still considered to be a valuable aircraft for operations in the harsh conditions of Alaska, with excellent landing and takeoff performance on gravel runways. The downside is the difficulty to find Avgas and the maintenance labor cost. Everts Air Cargo estimates a ratio of 12 hours of maintenance for every single flying hour. Spare parts could also be a problem but Everts Air Cargo anticipates they will have enough in stock to keep the last DC-6 flying beyond 2020.

*This 'List of Bengali poets' includes poets who write in Bengali language who produce Bengali poetry. This list classifies poets into three  groups based on geographical location. These are poets from Bangladesh, poets from West Bengal of India and poets from other parts of the world including Bengali Diaspora and non-Bengali people writing poetry in Bengali. However, the list starts with early Bengali poets to be followed by those who are identified not only with Indian sub-continent before partition in 1947, but also as founders of Bengali poetry. The list also contains separate sub-lists of "rhyme composers" and "song writers". Finally, there are two sub-sets of 'woman poets' and 'poets in exile'.
==Early poets==
=== Siddhacharyas ===
The poets of the 'Charyapada', known as the Siddhacharyas, lived in eastern India and Nepal. The surviving 50 manuscripts contains the name of 24 Siddhacharyas including Lui Pa, Kukkuri Pa, Birua Pa, Gundari Pa, Chatil Pa, Bhusuku Pa, Kanha Pa, Kambalambar Pa, Dombi Pa, Shanti Pa, Mahitta Pa, Bina Pa, Saraha Pa, Shabar Pa, Aryadeb Pa, Dhendhan Pa, Darik Pa, Bhade Pa, Tadak Pa, Kankan Pa, Ja’anandi Pa, Dham Pa, Tanti Pa and Loridombi Pa. Most of these names were pseudonyms as the poets rejected Vedic Hinduism and profess Sahajayana Buddhism. Lui Pa is considered as the earliest poet of Charjapadas. Kanha Pa's 11 poems survived which is the largest number among these poets.

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham ran for re-election to a second term, but he was defeated by his Democratic opponent, congresswoman Debbie Stabenow. Stabenow subsequently made history as the first woman to represent Michigan in the United States Senate. By a margin of 1.6%, this election was the second-closest race of the 2000 Senate election cycle, behind only the election in Washington.

Abraham, who was first elected in the 1994 Republican Revolution despite never running for public office before, was considered vulnerable by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Major issues in the campaign included prescription drugs for the elderly. By September 4, Abraham still had failed to reach 50% in polls despite having spent over $6 million on television ads. In mid-October, he came back and reached 50% and 49% in two polls respectively.

== Results ==
The election was very close with Stabenow prevailing by just over 67,000 votes. Stabenow was also likely helped by the fact that Vice President Al Gore won Michigan on the presidential level. Ultimately, Stabenow pulled out huge numbers out of the Democratic stronghold of Wayne County, which covers the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Stabenow also performed well in other heavily populated areas such as Ingham County home to the state's capital of Lansing, and the college town of Ann Arbor. Abraham did not concede right after major news networks declared Stabenow the winner; He held out hope that the few outstanding precincts could push him over the edge. At 4:00AM, Abraham conceded defeat. Senator Abraham called Stabenow and congratulated her on her victory. A historic election, Stabenow became the first woman to represent Michigan in the United States Senate.

==Biography==
Jesse Joseph Quin was born on 3 September 1981 in Bedford, England. His mother, Charity Quin, is a folk singer; his father, Rob Quin, was a sound engineer. Jesse has a sister named Amber.
Quin began his musical life at an early age. The first instrument he learned to play was the drums.

==Origins==
According to Arthur Evans, a tree cult played one of the most important aspects of the Minoan religion in ancient Crete. In this cult, two deities were worshipped; one male and one female. In this tree cult, while the Mother Goddess was viewed as a personification of tree-vegetation, the male god formed a "concrete image of the vegetation itself in the shape of a divine child or a youth", with the two forming a mother and child relationship. Given the role of the 'hieros gamos' between the two, it has been theorized that Velchanos was partially based on the Mesopotamian Dumuzid.
==Worship==
===Mycenaean period===
The Minoans viewed Velchanos as less powerful that the goddess.
At some point, the Mycenaean civilization came in contact with the Minoans, who identified their own god Zeus with the Cretan god. This religious syncretism led to Zeus obtaining some of Velchanos' traits, with his mythology also being affected; henceforth, Zeus was stated to have been born in Crete and was often represented as a beardless youth. He was also venerated as Zeus Velchanos.
===Hellenistic period===
In the 4th century BC, during the beginning of the Hellenistic era, Hagia Triada fell under the control of the 'polis' of Phaistos and was reinstated as a place of worship. In this period, an 'aedicula' was installed over a Minoan stoa in honor of Zeus Velchanos. In the same location, a bull protome was also found, built around the 2nd century BC, which is attributed to the shrine of Velchanos. Velchanos appears to have been worshipped in Gortyna as well, as coins depicting him have been found.
Velchanus' main festival, the Velchania, was likely celebrated in the Cretan 'polis' Gortyna, Lyttos, and Knossos.
==Iconography==
===Symbols===
Coins from Phaistos depicted Zeus Velchanos with a cock in his lap. These coins also depicted him with an oak tree. He was also depicted with a bull. At other times, Velchanos was depicted as an eagle.
==Influences on other cultures==
Given the similarities in naming, it has been suggested that Velchanos was an influence on Vulcan from Roman mythology.

*The 'Niobrara Reservation' is a former Indian Reservation in northeast Nebraska. It originally comprised lands for both the Santee Sioux and the Ponca, both Siouan-speaking tribes, near the mouth of the Niobrara River at its confluence with the Missouri River.  In the late nineteenth century the United States government built a boarding school at the reservation for the Native American children in the region. By 1908 after allotment of plots to individual households of the tribes under the Dawes Act,  were reserved for an agency, school and mission for a distinct Santee Sioux Reservation; the neighboring Ponca Reservation had only  reserved for agency and school buildings.
== Santee Sioux ==
In 1884, John Lenger organized an all-Indian brass band on the Niobrara Reservation, the Santee Sioux Band. The group
demonstrated the musical ability of the Santee and presented them in a favorable light to their white neighbors. The band, led by Lenger, appeared at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 and at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha in 1898 .. and ... a special command performance for President Benjamin Harrison.
In 1890, Special Agent Reuben Sears described the land as unsuitable for farming without irrigation. "Perhaps half of the lands on this reservation would produce half a crop usually, while the other half is absolutely worthless, except for grazing, and 10 acres of this would be requisite to sustain 1 steer ... Timber is not abundant on this reservation. A sufficient quantity is found for fuel and posts, and for present use only." The Indian population at the Santee and Flandreau Agency at that time was 869. The Santee were described as a community that raised ponies and horses and lived in log or frame houses with barns, but did not like to keep milk cows or hogs. The Santee displayed aptitude for music and carpentry, and continued their customs of moving between summer and winter homes and "congregating together." Sears concluded that "The Santees are practically self-sustaining, although occupying an almost barren reservation."
Sears noted that the Santee simply stopped talking altogether if asked about their tribal history or religious beliefs. Their unwillingness to discuss their history is understandable, given that memories of the Dakota War of 1862 were still relatively fresh. After the war, thirty-nine Sioux were killed in a mass execution in Mankato, Minnesota, and a third of the Indians imprisoned at Camp McClellan died of disease; some of these survivors were sent to Nebraska. Three hundred of the women, children, and old men at the post-war internment camp on Pike Island, near Fort Snelling, Minnesota, died due to poor conditions; in May 1863 Dakota survivors were forced aboard steamboats and relocated to the drought-stricken Crow Creek Reservation. Many of the survivors of Crow Creek moved three years later to the Niobrara Reservation.
== Ponca ==
By contrast, the Ponca on the reservation numbered about 217 people, raised cattle and hogs, and were willing to discuss their history and religion. They lived in small frame houses, and had adequate rainfall and well water to maintain well-kept farms.
== 1930s archaeological survey ==
In the 1930s, an archeological survey was begun on the Ponca/Niobrara Reservation south of the Niobrara River and Lynch, Nebraska.  In an effort to identify and save prehistoric artifacts before they were destroyed during agricultural development, the University of Nebraska and the Smithsonian Institution undertook a joint project.  The team excavated a prehistoric Ponca village; the ten laborers on the project were paid by the Works Progress Administration of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression. The project was to survey, identify and protect ancient resources. The Ponca village included large circular homes up to sixty feet in diameter; their residences were located for almost two miles (3 km) along the south bank of the Niobrara River.
Niobrara Island was included in the original reservation.

== Notes =='Voices' is a musical composition by the German composer Hans Werner Henze.
Written between January and June 1973, it is a collection of 22 independent songs which may be performed individually, with alterations to the instrumentation. In its full version, it is written for mezzo-soprano, tenor, electronics and fifteen instrumentalists who are required to play about 70 different instruments from all over the world. The piece consists of two parts (11 + 11 songs) and lasts 90 minutes. The polystylistic conception of "Voices" results from the different origin and message of the poems.
The songs set a diverse range of words, almost all of which are from the twentieth century, the linking theme being alienation and oppression. Henze has said: The voices of the title are those of young and old artists whose work is politically committed. These people are concerned with their fellow human beings, with the contemporary human condition within the world around them and with all the problems of race and class in which they themselves often seem fated to be embroiled. : „'Stimmen' für Hans Werner Henze. Die 22 Lieder aus 'Voices'“. Editor Peter Petersen, Hanns-Werner Heister and Hartmut Lück, Mainz, Schott 1996.
It was premiered on 4 January 1974 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London with soloists Paul Sperry and Rose Taylor, and the London Sinfonietta conducted by Henze. In 1978 it was recorded the same forces, except Sarah Walker who took the mezzo role.

=== Campaign ===
This election was in conjunction to the presidential election, where Bush narrowly defeated Gore after an intense recount. The Senate election was evenly matched, with two U.S. Congressmen named Bill in their mid-50s. Both parties heavily targeted this senate seat. The election became very nasty as Nelson called his opponent "an extremist who would sacrifice the elderly, the poor, and the  working class to coddle the rich." McCollum called the Democrat "a liberal who would tax everything that moves, and some things that don't." The election advertisements were very negative, as both candidates talked more about each other than themselves.
Nelson raised only soft money, but had help from Gore and President Bill Clinton. Two days before the election, McCollum predicted he would win by a 6-point margin. On election day, he lost by a five-point margin.

== References ==Location of Jos in Nigeria
The '2008 Jos riots' were riots involving Christians and Muslims over the result of a local election on 28 and 29 November 2008 in Jos, a city in the Middle Belt region of Nigeria. Two days of rioting left hundreds injured and at least 761 dead. The Nigerian army was deployed and by 30 November order was restored.
==Causes==
Electoral workers did not publicly list the winners of the elections, and rumours began that the election was won by the candidate of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), barrister Timothy Gyang Buba, defeating the candidate for the All Nigerian Peoples Party. People from the largely Muslim Hausa community, began protesting even before the results were released, which results to clash that claims hundred of lives between the Muslims and Christians, who largely supported Buba.
Similar riots in 2001 between Christians and Muslims in Jos also killed hundreds. A 2004 riot in Yelwa, another town in Plateau State resulted in the so-called Yelwa Massacre. Fighting in the north-central Kaduna State when it tried to impose shari'a law in 2000, resulted in the partition of Kaduna. This was followed by the Kaduna riots of November 2002, resulting from Nigeria's hosting of the Miss World contest, which one of its contestants had won the previous year.
==Riots==
The two days of rioting led to the death of at least 761 people, and homes, mosques, churches and schools were damaged or burned by mobs. The Nigerian Red Cross Society reported that 10,000 people fled their homes due to the riots, and were living in government-provided shelters. Nigerian soldiers were sent into Jos to break up the fighting and create a buffer zone between the Christians and Muslims. Flights to and from Jos were cancelled and roads to the north were blocked.
==Effects==
Jonah Jang, the governor of the Plateau State, imposed a 24-hour curfew on four districts of the city, and soldiers were permitted to "shoot on sight" to prevent more violence. Human Rights Watch alleged that soldiers and police carried out more than 130 extrajudicial killings while responding to the riots. Many armed youths of both sides were arrested at military roadblocks. Police reported that more than 500 people were arrested as a result of the riots. But state officials said no one was successfully prosecuted.

==References=='Shirakaba-ha' members
The  was an influential Japanese literary coterie, which published the literary magazine 'Shirakaba', from 1910 to 1923.
==History==
In 1910, a loose association of alumni of the prestigious Gakushuin Peer’s School in Tokyo began a literary society. Members included writers, artists, literary critics and others who rejected Confucianism and the strictures of traditional Japanese literary and artistic styles. In particular, the group emphasized idealism, humanism and individualism, over the naturalism that had been the dominant trend in Japanese literature of the Taishō period. The 'Shirakaba-ha' thought highly of Western aesthetics (particularly Expressionism and Post-Impressionism), and considered their mission to spread the ideas of Western art and Western literature into Japan. Unlike many other literary circles, The Shirakaba-ha did not limit their interest to literature, but also delved into other art forms. However, the group remained deeply interested in Japanese culture, particularly in folk art, which had previously been disparaged by traditional art critics.
Cover of 1st edition of 'Shirakaba' journal
Early members included Shiga Naoya (1883-1971), Mushanokōji Saneatsu (1885-1976), Yanagi Sōetsu (1889-1961), Satomi Ton (1888-1983), Arishima Takeo (1878-1923) and Nagayo Yoshirō (1888-1961). Their literature was typically of the ‘I novel’ genre, and was concerned with the life of individuals, often incorporating optimistic philosophy into their work. Some of these individuals came with wealthy families, and attempted to emulate Tolstoy in creating utopian agrarian communes in remote parts of Japan. The self-published monthly literary journal 'Shirakaba' ("White Birch") was in circulation from April 1910 until 1923. The magazine reached its peak in popularity in 1918. However, publication was discontinued after the Great Kantō earthquake.

== Dating ==
The Greek geographer Strabo (63 BC–AD 21), who lived in Nysa, mentioned a secret water conduit in the town, but it remains unclear whether he meant the existing tunnel-like bridge. An inscription at the northern wall of the tube, close to a bend after , indicates a construction date in late imperial times. It reads "Work of Praülos until this point".
== Construction ==
The Nysa Bridge served as a substructure for the area in front of the city theatre which lay close to the Cakircak stream. It was built as a two-level structure: the bottom vault spanned the brook. On top of it a row of arches connected the two hills that formed the urban area. The ground arch spanned the stream on a length of some , giving the bridge the appearance of a tube or a tunnel, although it was constructed entirely above ground. It consists of a single,  wide vault whose uphill mouth widens to . The overall height of its semi-circular arch is , featuring a rise of . The vault is made of rubble stone laid in mortar, resting on a substructure of ashlar stone blocks of varying size (0.3–0.9 x 1.0–1.4 m). Originally featuring a continuous vaulting, it is collapsed today between m 75 and 85, and again at the downhill exit. The remaining, isolated structure at the downstream side has often been incorrectly referred to as a bridge of its own. The Nysa Bridge was the second largest bridge substruction of its kind in antiquity, only surpassed by the nearby Bridge at Pergamon. By comparison, the width of a normal, free standing Roman bridge did not exceed . 
In its further course, the Cakircak also ran through the city stadion, so that naumachia could be given. There are remains of two other ancient bridges both up- and downstream.
== Discharge capacity ==
The capacity limit of the Nysa Bridge in case of floods has been the subject of hydraulic and hydrological research. The gradient of the tunnel was calculated as 3.3% with a maximum discharge capacity of 290 m³/s. Exceeding this limit puts the bridge under internal pressure and damages the structure in the process. Considering that the Cakircak is  long, with a median gradient of 19% and a drainage basin of , the following median intervals were calculated, depending on the method employed:
*7,500 years (Günerman method)
*10,500 years (D.S.I. method)
*13,000 years (Mockus method)
*68,000 years (Snyder method)
The study came to the conclusion that statistically every 13,500 years, a value which has been referred to as the "arithmetic mean", floods are to be expected which would exceed the capacity of the bridge.

== History ==
The band was founded in Linz in 1970, and recorded its first album entitled 'Eela Craig' in 1971 with a circulation of 1,500. Critics compared this album with established bands such as Emerson, Lake & Palmer, King Crimson, Gentle Giant and Colosseum. The band had a few onstage performances with the Zürich Chamber Orchestra in 1972, which led to more performances in well known opera houses of Italy, Germany and Austria, uncommon venues for a rock band at the time.
The band signed a contract with Virgin Records in 1975, to release a number of singles and albums, including the Christian concept album 'Missa Universalis', and a signature ethereal style cover version of Chris de Burgh's 'A Spaceman Came Travelling', both released in 1978.
'Missa Universalis' was a musical translation of a (Catholic) high mass, which embraced lyrics in Latin, German, English and French languages. The compositions resembled the works of Anton Bruckner, mixed with elements of rock and electronic music. The premiere was performed at the 'Brucknerfest' of the city of Linz and received positive acceptance.
The band was largely inactive between 1982 and 1986, but the two founding members produced solo music under the 'Bognermayr/Zuschrader' name with 'Bognermayr's' own New Age label 'Erdenklang'. 1987 saw the release of three singles, which were targeted to match the contemporary Pop Music style. Eela Craig released their last album 'Hit or Miss' in 1987.
On 17 November 1995, the band reunited for a one-time live performance in Linz. At the same time, Hubert Bognermayr published a compilation of the band's music entitled 'Symphonic Rock'.

Her father died, aged 61, when she was 10. Verena Wagner grew up in the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth and attended the Obernkirchener rural school. Adolf Hitler greatly favoured Wagner's music and became very close to Verena's mother, Winifred Wagner, who was a fanatical admirer of Hitler; there were even rumours that they would marry. She met him at the Bayreuth Festival in 1923. Hitler also befriended her children and treated them as his own.
Indeed, in 1940 Verena Wagner and Hitler were also rumoured to be romantically linked, although Hitler was said to have been uncomfortable with how the public would accept their three-decade age gap.
Many people affirm that Hitler would gladly marry the granddaughter of Richard Wagner, twenty-year-old, vivacious Verena Wagner, who is a frequent visitor and vacation guest at his mountain snuggery, were he not opposed in principle to marriages between persons of such unequal ages. She has the reputation of being his most outspoken critic, telling him in unflattering words simple truths that no Cabinet member would dare utter.
In 1943 Verena Wagner married Bodo Lafferentz, a member of the Nazi Party from 1933 and a high-ranking officer ('SS-Obersturmbannführer') of the SS from 1939, assigned to the Race and Settlement Office. After World War II, her husband was interned during the Allies' denazification program, and released in 1949. They had five children: Amélie (1944–), Manfred (1945–), Winifred (1947–), Wieland (1949–) and Verena (1952–).
She was distinguished from other Wagner family members by her lack of artistic ambition, except for occasional appearances at the Bayreuth Festival and other musical commemorations honoring her grandfather. Wagner Lafferentz attended the International Richard Wagner Congress held in Copenhagen in 2003, attending as guest of honour a performance of 'Die Walküre' by the Royal Danish Opera with Queen Margrethe, Prince Henrik, the patron of the Wagner Congress, Wolfgang and Gudrun Wagner, and Birgit Nilsson. In February 2007 she opened, as guest of honour, a grand concert of her grandfather's works at Sofia in Bulgaria.
Verena Wagner Lafferentz lived in modest retirement in the family's summer home in the village of Nußdorf in Überlingen, Germany, on Lake Constance, near the Swiss border. She died at her home in Nußdorf in 2019, at the age of 98. Wagner Lafferentz was an honorary member of various international Wagner societies, the vice-chairman of the Richard Wagner Foundation, and a foundation board member of the Bayreuth Festival.

It is located at 32° 15' 50N,73° 41' 40E with an altitude of 206 meters (679 feet). It is the oldest village which is believed to pre-date to Mughal era.
The village consists of approximately 200 homes, and total population of approximately 1500 as of 2008. It is situated on the bank of a canal that originates from the Barrage Qadirabad Colony. Most of the land suffers from seepage which make it unsuitable for cultivation. This is the reason many residents have been driven the away from village to either big city for work or converted their lands into fish farms. Presently the village is surrounded on all sides with fish farms. The village forms an artificial peninsula.
Thatha Shamsa is bounded by rivers and canals. The major canal that originates from Chenab River at Qadirabad barragein the west of the village. The River Chenab is a few miles away from village, and during monsoon weather the village faces a threat of flooding. The weather is usually intemperate in summer and winter but autumn and spring are mild. The weather is usually dry and humid but few rains due to monsoons in summer season. There are few rains in winter season due to Western depression.
==Geography and climate==
Thatha Shamsa (Chattha) is bounded by the river and a canal. The canal, which runs parallel to Thatha Shamasa comes from the Qadirabad barrage and is in west of Thatha Shamsa.  The climate is mainly dry with rains in the summer due to the monsoons and there are also a few rains in the winter due to the western depression. The land is plain and good for agriculture and Fish Farming with plenty of water supply. Farmers have also dug many tube wells due to the undependable climate.
==Transport==
There are no scheduled modes of transport in this village. Most of the time, the people have to travel towards Sooianwala or Hara Kote or Qadir Abad Colony to get the access to transport that travel to bigger cities of the Pakistan, like Lahore, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Ali Pure Chattha etc. Recently the transport system has been improved by the provision of some special routes towards big cities of Punjab. For casual works, the villagers use motorcycle and bicycle as the most convenient and fast transport system.
==Recreational Activities==
People of village have a limited choice for their recreational activities. Most of the time, the people go to Qadirabad Colony and Hari Kote to enjoy the restaurants foods and for other miscellaneous activities. The villagers usually play football, crickets and Kabadi. In this regards Thatha Shamsa team has won many cricket tournaments which held in that region. But the lack of good playing grounds drive them to travel sometime 2 km to have their games.
==Educational Institutes==
There are two primary schools which are funded and governed by Government of Punjab. Government Primary School for Boys (Headmaster Sh.Qamar-o-Zaman) and Government Primary School for Girls which is under consideration to be upgraded to Middle school in near future.  As most of the villagers are poor, so they send their children into these public schools. A few families in this village are richer, and they send their children to Private English medium School. Most children, after completing their primary education, move to Sooianwal town to get higher education.

'Ruhrfisch comments': Very briefly, here are some suggestions for improvement. 
*The lead does not really follow WP:LEAD. The lead should be an accessible and inviting overview of the whole article, nothing important should be in the lead only - since it is a summary, it should all be repeated in the body of the article itself. Most of the names paragraph or the most snow at the ski area is not in the body of the article, for example. 
*Per WP:CITE references come AFTER punctuation, and are usually at the end of a sentence or phrase. They should also be in numerical order, so fix things like '...  about 31 miles (50 km) 8 due east of the city of Bellingham, Whatcom County, making it the northernmost volcano in the Cascade Range but not the northernmost of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, which extends north into the Coast Mountains. Additionally, it is the fourth highest mountain in Washington State and the sixth highest in the Cascade Range.93' move ref 8, make it 39
*Per WP:MOS#Images, images should be set to thumb width to allow reader preferences to take over. For portrait format images, "upright" can be used to make the image narrower. 
*Statements like '... the volume of snow and ice on Mount Baker (0.43 cubic miles, 1.8 cubic kilometers) is greater than that of all the other Cascades volcanoes (except Rainier) combined.' are confusing - perhaps say something like "the volume of snow and ice is second greatest after Mount Rainier, and is greater than that of all of the other Cascade volcanoes."
*Avoid short (one or two sentence) paragraphs - combine with others or expand to improve the flow of the aricle.
*I would put the history in chronological order - now it skips around from hundreds of thousands of years ago, to "Modern Mount Baker" (violates WP:HEAD by repeating the title of the article), to 6,600 years ago, then 1792.
*A model article is often useful for ideas and examples to follow. There are some mountain / volcano FAs that would be great models, see Mount St. Helens, Mount Tambora, Mount Pinatubo, and Mauna Loa. 
Hope this helps. If my comments are useful, please consider peer reviewing an article, especially one at Wikipedia:Peer review/backlog (which is how I found this article).

'David Stone Martin', born 'David Livingstone Martin' (June 13, 1913 – March 1, 1992 in New London, Connecticut) was an American artist best known for his illustrations on jazz record albums.
==Biography==
David Stone Martin was born June 13, 1913, in Chicago and attended evening classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He was greatly influenced by the line art of Ben Shahn. During World War II, Martin was an art director for the United States Office of War Information.
By 1950, Martin had produced more than 100 covers for Mercury, Asch, Disc and Dial record albums. Many assignments came from his longtime friend, record producer Norman Granz.
For various companies, Martin eventually created illustrations for more than 400 record albums. Many of these were simply line art combined with a single color. Martin's favorite tool was a crowquill pen which enabled him to do delicate line work. CBS-TV art director William Golden gave Martin many print ad assignments during the 1950s, and Martin soon expanded into illustration for 'Seventeen', 'The Saturday Evening Post' and other slick magazines of the 1950s and 1960s. His studio was located in Roosevelt, New Jersey, near his home there.
Martin is represented in the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Smithsonian Institution.
Martin was the husband of muralist Thelma Martin, who painted the post office mural for the facility in Sweetwater, Tennessee. He was the father of graphic artist Stefan Martin (born 1936) and painter Tony Martin. He died March 1, 1992, in New London, Connecticut, where he had lived in his old age.

*'The Treason Act 1543' (35 Hen 8 c 2) was an Act of the Parliament of England passed during the reign of King Henry VIII of England, which stated that acts of treason or misprision of treason that were committed outside the realm of England could be tried within England. Those convicted of high treason would have their estates confiscated by the King and then be hanged, drawn and quartered.
This Act received renewed attention in 1769, following protests against the Townshend Acts in colonial Boston. After determining that the 1543 Treason Act was still in effect, Parliament instructed Governor Francis Bernard of Massachusetts to gather evidence against Bostonians who might have committed acts of treason, so that they could be transported to England for trial. Colonial assemblies in British America passed resolutions against such an action, arguing that it would violate their constitutional right to a trial by jury of their peers.
No one in Massachusetts was arrested under the terms of the Treason Act, but the matter came up again in Rhode Island after the 'Gaspée' Affair in 1772. Once again, officials were unable to obtain reliable evidence of treason.
The Act was repealed on 1 January 1968 by section 10(2) of, and Part I of Schedule 3 to, the Criminal Law Act 1967.
==Other treason statutes passed in 1543==
The Act should not be confused with two other Acts, 35 Hen. 8 c. 1 and 3, which were also about treason and were passed in the same year. The first made it treason to refuse to take an oath against the Pope. The second made it treason to attempt to deprive the King of his royal title or of his title as Defender of the Faith and as Supreme Head of the Church in England and Ireland. Both forms of treason were abolished in 1547, but the latter was revived in the first year of the reign of Elizabeth I.

* Full text of ActThere was a by-election for the constituency of Rutherglen in the House of Commons on 14 May 1964, not long before the 1964 general election.
It was a Labour gain from the Conservatives, the candidate was Gregor Mackenzie. Unlike some by-election gains, it was held at the next general election and eventually became a fairly safe Labour seat, with Mackenzie serving as MP until 1987. The defeated Conservative candidate, Iain Sproat, later served as the MP for Aberdeen South and Harwich. The Scottish National Party decided not to contest the election, even though it was party policy to contest all Scottish by-elections.
==Background==
The by-election was one of four (the others being Bury St Edmunds, Devizes and Winchester being held on the same day in which the seat was being defended by a candidate supporting the incumbent Conservative government. With a general election due later in the year, the results were anticipated with interest as a pointer to  what might happen at the election. It was felt voter turnout could be crucial and Sproat's agent, F. W. S. Craig had arranged for 1000 party workers and 300 cars to be active on polling day. 'The Glasgow Herald' felt that Sproat could win if turnout was over 80%.
==Result==
==Aftermath==
The result showed a considerable swing of 7.6% against the government. While it held Winchester, there was an even larger swing of 8.5% against the Conservatives there. 'The Glasgow Herald' considered the result in Rutherglen significant as the Conservatives had won the seat in 1951 when they had a small overall majority and swings were usually less pronounced in Scotland than the rest of the UK. The newspaper suggested that the results were repeated at a general election the Labour Party would have a majority of about 120 seats. An editorial in 'The Glasgow Herald' the day after the election said that while the Conservatives holding Devizes perhaps suggested the party's fortunes were improving in England, the Rutherglen result was "a rank bad one" for the party, which did not suggest that any recovery in their position was taking place in Scotland. Indeed it further noted that there been a swing to Labour in Scotland in 1959 against the UK-wide trend, and the result suggested Labour was further improving upon this. The 'Herald's' editorial argued that it was still possible for the Conservatives to improve their position in Scotland before the general election, which was expected to be held in October, but that the party needed to widen its Scottish horizons and improve its presentation to show the economic and political improvements the government had carried out.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Petals_Around_the_Rose#Showing_the_solution
====Who else is involved in the disagreement?====
Public members on the talk page.
====Briefly, what's the problem?====
Some say a solution to a puzzle should not be shown.  Others say it should be shown.
====...What's keeping it from being solved?====
There is no conclusion that everyone will accept.
====...What do you want fixed?====
The solution should be removed to reach a neutral state.  If both parties cannot agree on a conclusion I believe the least harmful option should be put in place.  That would be leaving the solution out of the article.
====How about a limerick or haiku? Code? Drawing?====
A limerick, haiku, or code would be nice to include on the page if it were available, but should definitely not replace the solution altogether. Consensus on the talk page says that the solution should be included, and anything else is fair game. Z't'O'b'O'r' 22:04, 5 December 2008 (UTC)
I do no believe there is a consensus.  I believe you are taking the views of others which match yours.  There are several people who clearly state that the solution should NOT be shown.  There seem to be a few persistent individuals who continue to fight on the side of showing the solution.
It is simply your opinion to show the solution.
Trenchant (talk) 07:20, 6 December 2008 (UTC)
It's not a complete consensus, but it's enough for the article to remain unchanged. It is your (strong enough) opinion that this should be taken to mediation. Most of the people on here have stopped arguing, myself included. And the talk page is not the only place to look for consensus on an issue. If you look at the edit history, a variety of people have reverted the edits to the page. Z't'O'b'O'r' 01:00, 8 December 2008 (UTC)
:Your logic is flawed.  The solution was originally NOT shown.  Persistent users continued to return and add the solution in.  There has never been a conclusion to this dispute.  People merely lose interest in wasting their time in a looping arguement.  That is why I requested mediation.Trenchant (talk) 07:42, 2 January 2009 (UTC)
::I hate to bring this back up, but the solution was posted on the second edit of this article, by the same person who created the article. Although, it 'was' under white colour tags, but that brings the issue of consensus to whether the answer should have a spoiler warning instead, instead of whether it should exist at all on the page. It has only been people who saw this article afterwards that decided to remove the solution altogether.
::I believe this nullifies your original argument, bring the context elsewhere. Z't'O'b'O'r' 22:50, 11 February 2009 (UTC)'SM 'U-23' or 'U-XXIII' was a  or U-boat built for and operated by the Austro-Hungarian Navy ( or ) during the First World War. The design for 'U-23' was based on that of the submarines of the Royal Danish Navy's 'Havmanden' class (which had been designed by Whitehead & Co. in Fiume), and was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war.
'U-23' was just over  long and was armed with two bow torpedo tubes, a deck gun, and a machine gun. In February 1918, 'U-23' was sunk with all hands by the Italian torpedo boat 'Airone' while attempting an attack on the Italian transport . 'U-23' had no wartime successes.
== Design and construction ==
When it became apparent to the Austro-Hungarian Navy that the First World War would not be a short one, they moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish 'Havmanden' class submarines, which had been designed by Whitehead & Co. in Fiume, who had built three units. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for 'U-23' and her three sister boats on 27 March 1915.
'U-23' was one of two boats of the class to be built at the Hungarian UBAG yard in Fiume. Due to demands by the Hungarian government, subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, and this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design, resulting in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general.
'U-23' was an ocean-going submarine that displaced  surfaced and  submerged and was designed for a complement of 18. She was  long with a beam of  and a draft of . For propulsion, she featured a single shaft, a single  diesel engine for surface running, and a single  electric motor for submerged travel. She was capable of  while surfaced and  while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for 'U-23', the 'Havmanden' class, upon which the 'U-20' class was based, had a range of  at , surfaced, and  at  submerged.
'U-23' was armed with two  torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. She was also equipped with a /26 deck gun and an  machine gun.
== Service career ==
'U-23' was launched on 5 January 1917, but It is not known with certainty when 'U-23' was commissioned. Author Paul Halpern reports that 'U-23' and her three sisters all entered service between August and November 1917. Although there are no specific reports of problems with 'U-23', the 'U-20' class as a whole suffered from unreliable engines which compounded the poor handling characteristics of the boats.
On 21 February 1918, 'Linienschiffsleutnant' Klemens Ritter von Bézard, 'U-23's only commanding officer, was guiding the boat in an attack on the Italian transport  in the Straits of Otranto. 'U-23' came under attack by the Italian torpedo boat 'Airone' which first tried to ram the U-boat, and then deployed an explosive paravane. When the paravane contacted the submerged 'U-23', it exploded, blowing debris into the air and sinking the submarine with all hands. Like all of her sister boats, 'U-23' had no wartime successes.

*Emil Selenka, around 1870
'Emil Selenka' (27 February, 1842, Braunschweig – 20 February, 1902, Munich) was a German zoologist. He is known for his research on invertebrates and apes and the scientific expeditions he organized to Southeast Asia and South America.
Selenka was the son of bookbinder Johannes Selenka (1801–1871). He studied natural history at the University of Göttingen, and following a graduate dissertation on Holothuroidea, he remained in Göttingen as an assistant to Wilhelm Moritz Keferstein (1833-1870). His research was in this period mainly on the anatomy, taxonomy and embryology of marine invertebrates, especially organisms from the phylum Echinodermata. In 1868 he became a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Leiden, followed by a professorship at the University of Erlangen in 1874. In 1895 he was given an honorary professorship at the University of Munich. He was co-founder of the journal 'Biologisches Zentralblatt'.
His later research was on mammals. He studied the early development of the embryo and the development of the germ layer in mammals, and did comparative anatomic research on apes, especially gibbons and orangutans. He found evidence that the lateral distribution of orangutan races was caused by geographic isolation (a process called allopatric speciation). Selenka also examined the evolution of marsupials and their morphologic relation with reptiles. One problem he was interested in, was the evolutionary relation between Australian and South American marsupials.
In order to collect material, Selenka organized expeditions to tropical countries. In 1877 he undertook an expedition to Brasil. From 1892 he led an expedition that lasted two years to Southeast Asia, it visited Ceylon, the Dutch East Indies, Japan, China and Australia. Among the participants was his second wife, the zoologist and feminist Margarethe Selenka (1860-1922), whom he married in 1893. When Selenka became severely ill during his stay in the Dutch East Indies and had to return to Germany, his wife continued exploring the jungles of Borneo by herself. The couple wrote a report of their journeys together, titled "'Sonnige Welten- Ostasiatische Reiseskizzen'". Other publications by Emil Selenka are:
* 'Beiträge zur Anatomie und Systematik der Holothurien', (1867).
* 'Zoologische Studien', (1878).
* 'Studien über Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere', (12 volumes, 1883–1913, with Ambrosius Hubrecht).
* "Report on the Gephyrea, collected by H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873-1876"; (published in English, 1885).
* 'Zoologisches Taschenbuch für Studierende zum Gebrauch bei Vorlesungen und praktischen Übungen zusammengestellt', (1897).
Between 1873 and 1874 and again from 1889 Selenka was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Career==
Brown began working as an Assistant editor for 'Dragon' magazine in 1989, on issues #147 to #151 (July–November 1989). She was later transferred to TSR's Games Division. She worked mostly as an editor, although she did design a number of modules and supplements including 'Falcon's Revenge', 'Falconmaster', and 'Flames of the Falcon' (Greyhawk, 1990, with Richard W. Brown), 'Ship of Horror' (Ravenloft, 1991), 'Unsung Heroes' (Dragonlance, 1992), 'Aurora's Whole Realms Catalog' (Forgotten Realms, 1992), and 'Children of the Night: Ghosts' (Ravenloft, 1997). Brown was a vocal advocate within TSR of the Greyhawk setting, and designed the 'Player's Guide to Greyhawk' (1998). Brown's 'Player's Guide to Greyhawk' and Roger E. Moore's 'Return of the Eight' and 'The Adventure Begins' returned TSR to Greyhawk, and according to Shannon Appelcline "moved the setting's metaplot well beyond the Greyhawk Wars to a new era that that was lighter and more magical than that of 'From the Ashes'".
Brown left TSR in August 1997, and did work for Fast Forward Entertainment from 2002-2003. She has also written educational nonfiction books for middle schoolers.

*The Pan African Historical Theatre Project now known as 'PANAFEST' is a cultural event held in Ghana every two years for Africans and people of African descent. It was first held in 1992. The idea of this festival is to promote and enhance unity, Pan-Africanism, and the development of the continent of Africa itself. Activities that occur at this festival are performances and work in the areas of theatre, drama, music, and poetry, among other things. Also, there are viewing of the durbar of chiefs, and tours to various places of interest, such as slave castle dungeons.
==Impetus and objectives==
PANAFEST was mooted by the late Efua Sutherland in the mid-1980s as a cultural vehicle for bringing Africans on the continent and in the diaspora together around the issues raised by slavery that remain suppressed. PANAFEST addresses the most traumatic interruption that ever occurred in the natural evolution of African societies, which among other traumas profoundly eroded the self-confidence and freedom for self-determination of a whole people. Ghana’s coastline is dotted with now silent memorials to over 500 years of this most turbulent era in Africa’s history, which the festival consciously makes a site for confronting the effects of enslavement, purging the pain of the diaspora, acknowledging the residual effects of the trade on the African continent and re-uniting to forge a positive future in the contemporary global environment.
Alongside the healing processes, PANAFEST celebrates the strengths and resilience of African culture and achievements of Africans in spite of the transatlantic slave trade and its aftermath. It is designed to help Africans to reconnect with their strengths and thus be inspired to eternal vigilance, rededicate themselves to fully assuming the reigns of their own destiny in recognition of the lessons of history. 
There are today urgent developments making this proudly Ghanaian initiative a vital and relevant platform that provides members of the African family with the opportunity to engage with each other in forthright communication. Among these are negatives such as human trafficking from the continent, the brain drain, marginalization of Africans in a global knowledge economy, the renewed surge of external pursuit of African natural resources and the slowness of African unification. There are also positive factors including enabling global conventions and coalitions and African initiatives to establish transnational businesses, add value to community initiatives, take advantage of technologies and mobilize the strength of Africans around the globe.
==PANAFEST and the Ghanaian State==
PANAFEST is an international event that, as has happened since Independence in the mid-20th century, makes Ghana a motivational force for African peoples. Since 1992, the festival has attracted participation by official delegations, individuals and groups from African, Caribbean and South American countries, as well as groups and individuals from Europe and the United States. The government of Ghana considers this a major national initiative and appreciates the agencies, communities, civil society organizations and corporate bodies which have mobilized resources to complement government efforts over the years. The government of Ghana is also deeply appreciative of all sister governments for their participation and the African Union for lending its auspices to this unique cultural manifestation.

It is a state institution, but it should not be confused with the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, the central bank which coins money. The BN (its official Spanish initials) belongs to the Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance. Its headquarters is located in the San Isidro District of Lima, the capital of Peru.
==History==
The BN was created January 27, 1966, by Law 16000, approved by the Peruvian congress and was signed into law by the then-president Fernando Belaúnde Terry. Its predecessors date to 1905, when José Pardo created the 'Caja de Depósitos y Consignaciones' or 'Bank of Deposits and Consignments'.
The Bank of the Nation has function uninterrupted since its creation. Currently, it employs its own system of ATMs and provides its own credit and debit cards.
==Functions==
Throughout the years, the bank's functions have either been expanded or reduced according to the policies of the current government although its most basic functions usually never change. Currently, the Bank of the Nation is used to:
*Provide payment services in accordance with the policies of the General Directory of the Public Treasury
*Provide collection services on behalf of tax creditors
*Perform operations on behalf of sub-accounts of the public treasury
*Act as the primary financial agency of the state
*Act on the behalf of other banks and financial institutions in the channeling of resources
*Participate in the foreign commerce transactions of the state
*Grant credit to the Central Government, to Regional governments, and to local governments, in cases when they have not been granted by the National Finance System
*Credit granted by the bank is not subject to the limits established by the General Law of Banking, Financial, and Insurance institutions
*Provide correspondence services
*Provide services to accounts of entities belonging both the National public sector and state providers
*Receive savings deposits in locations where private banks don't have offices
==Distribution==
Branch offices can be found in every Peruvian province, with a total of 403 branch offices, of which 87% are located in rural areas of the country where private banks do not operate

The 'Snowdon Theatre' was a Streamline Moderne style cinema in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, located on Decarie Boulevard in the neighbourhood of Snowdon. After the theater closed, it was re-purposed as mini-shopping center with gymnastics studio, and then later demolished to build condominiums. Only its exterior facade survives.
==History==
The theater opened in February 1937 with a lavish art deco interior by designer Emmanuel Briffa, designer of the interior of the Rialto Theatre and 60 other cinemas in Canada.
In 1950 the entrance facade was modified and a new marquee was added. In 1968 it showed X-rated movies. In 1972 it screened Charlie Chaplin films for approximately an entire year. The cinema closed in May 1982 and was vacant. In 1990 it was re-purposed as a small shopping center. The 25,000 square foot interior was rebuilt by Rafid Louis and Emile Fattal, splitting the theater into two floors and sub-dividing the remaining space. The theater's original wall and ceiling art deco remained intact on the second floor, where a gymnastics center operated for a number of years. In 2013 the building was vacant again, then boarded up and left abandoned.
==Demolition==
The building was not a success with its retail shopping and offices and by the late 1990s was mostly vacant. Flexart Gymnastics, the last tenant, was evicted in late 2013 due to safety concerns with the building's roof. The city of Montreal owned the building and had no plans to repair the roof or any do renovations, which put its future into question.
In January 2016, the city put the building up for sale. On March 26, 2016 a fire on the second floor caused heavy damage to the roof. On May 4, 2017, it was reported the city found a buyer for the building who planned to demolish it for either a commercial or residential building project (likely condominiums). The sale went through on February 3, 2018 for $1.6 million, with the only condition that the building's exterior front facade and sign be preserved.
In April 2019, the building was completely demolished, with only the front façade wall left standing and its marquee sign.

No further edits should be made to this page.'Mount Leura' is a 313-metre scoria cone surrounding a dry crater 100 m deep and is the central and most obvious component of a larger volcanic complex southeast of the town of Camperdown located in western Victoria, Australia, 194 kilometres (121 mi) south west of the state capital, Melbourne. The inactive volcano is thought to have last erupted between 5,000 and 20,000 years ago. The name means "big nose" in local aboriginal dialect.
==Leura Maar==
Mount Leura, together with nearby Mount Sugarloaf, forms part of a large extinct volcanic complex known as the "Leura Maar".  The complex includes a broad shallow maar crater measuring 2.5 km by 1.7 km surrounded by a low tuff ring, inside which are the secondary eruption points of Mount Leura and several smaller unnamed mounds and cones of scoria. These may represent eruptions along a north–south fissure. The walls of the cone are alternating layers of tuff and scoria with numerous blocks and volcanic bombs. Mount Sugarloaf is a perfect conical mound on the southwestern flank of Mount Leura and represents a final stage of activity of the Leura volcano, when a small vent ejected a large volume of lava fragments in a short time, without a change in the direction of the eruption column. This produced a steep, symmetrical, conical mound of volcanic ash, scoria and larger blocks and bombs.
==Mining==
Numerous quarries operated within the "Leura Maar". Quarries also provide significant exposures of bedding in tuff and scoria and many xenoliths are obtained from these. The scoria at Mount Leura is notable for the inclusions of high temperature megacrusts and xenoliths (fragments of the lower crust and mantle of the earth) which occur here in unusually high concentrations. Most of the quarries now are closed and some are used for dumping landfill.
==Tourism==
The volcano lies within the 'Lakes and Craters' region, an access road was built in 1932. It allows vehicles the size of buses to access the lookout on top of Mount Leura. On a clear day you can see the Grampians and Mount Buninyong to the north, Mount Porndon to the east and Lavers Hill to the south. To the immediate west are the deep volcanic crater lakes Bullen-Merri and Gnotuk while to the east is the crater Lake Purrumbete popular for its Trout and Chinook Salmon fishing.
==Hillclimb==
Mount Leura has hosted the Australian Hillclimb Championship twice, 1985 and 1997. The access road to the summit is closed for the competition.
The Australian Hillclimb Championship has been sanctioned by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport since 1954. Prior to this it was sanctioned by the Australian Automobile Association, with two events having national championship status in 1949.

He is esteemed as a godfather in the South Korean football. He was diligent and only absorbed in the football. He extremely avoided harmful things to human body including alcohol and tobacco, and had ardor for training. He played as a centre-half, but he was a playmaker who took part in the attack. He was noted for his workrate, rapid pace, and elaborate techniques, which could go around the field while he didn't drop the ball to the ground. Japan also couldn't ignore his skills, and selected him for the Japan national team.
Kim became the only Korean, selected for the Japan squad for the 1936 Summer Olympics, and contributed to defeating Sweden by assisting the winning goal in the tournament. In 1937, Kim joined Waseda University which had many Japan national team's players but he went back to Korea because of the discrimination about Korean. He could participate in the Olympics with Korean nationality after the end of the Japanese forced occupation. He achieved the first victory of the South Korea football history against Mexico in the 1948 Summer Olympics, in which he participated as a player-coach. After the retirement, he managed South Korea at the 1954 FIFA World Cup and 1960 AFC Asian Cup.

*'Kvir' (Квир, from English 'queer') is a Russian gay lifestyle magazine. It was launched by www.gay.ru which runs the LGBT Center "Together", a non-profit organization. The magazine is a non-profit project designed to provide Russian society with correct and diverse information on homosexuality, to increase public tolerance of homosexuals, as well as to support and unify the gay community in Russia. It is also made to raise self-acceptance within the gay community. The magazine's name (Kvir) stems from the English word "queer".
== History ==
The glossy color magazine was first published in 2003. Yearly circulation was 33000 issues. "Kvir" entered the top five best-selling "men's magazines" in Moscow according to the rating of SIRPP - the Union of publishers and distributors of printed products in Russia in September 2004 and September 2006.
The physical publication ceased in 2012 with 113 issues printed. KVIR is transitioned to an all-digital format and currently is an online Internet magazine.
== Publishing house ==
In addition to the magazine, publishing house "Kvir" was established in 2005 with the book "69. Russian gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals". Since then, more than 30 books have been published. These are collections of prose and poetry by authors from Russia, Canada, USA, Italy, Germany and other countries of the world. The house publishes yearly mini-anthologies “Russian Gay Prose” and “Lesbian Prose”. Today, "Kvir" is the oldest publishing gay project in Russia.
==Authors==
Among the authors of the magazine are fashion historian Alexander Vasilyev, writers Almat Malatov, Margarita Sharapova, Andrei Goncharov, Marusya Klimova, Dmitry Bushuev, playwright Konstantin Kostenko, publicist Yevgeny Ponasenkov. The magazine published photo shoots of Russian and international photographers - Serge Golovach, Seva Galkin, Olga Fomina and others. The magazine published interviews with Roman Viktyuk, Svetlana Surganova, Yaroslav Mogutin, Boris Moiseev, Thomas Anders and many others.
==Notes==The '1977 Detroit Lions season' was their 48th in the National Football League (NFL). The team matched their previous season's output of 6–8. The team missed the playoffs for the seventh straight season. The Lions struggled offensively, scoring a mere 183 points while finishing in third place with a 6–8 record for the second straight season.
The 1977 coaching staff included 25-year-old assistant special teams and offensive assistant coach Bill Belichick. Belichick would later win two Super Bowls as defensive coordinator with the New York Giants following the 1986 and 1990 seasons, and six more as head coach of the New England Patriots.

No further edits should be made to this page.'Corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST)' is tubing made of stainless steel with corrugation on the inside or outside.
CSST is not FAC (Flexible Appliance Connector) tubing. Presently, CSST and FAC tubing both use corrugated stainless steel tubing. In the past, FAC used corrugated brass tubing. However, FAC tubing is made only in lengths of 1 to 6 feet, FAC tubing is made with connectors on each end, and FAC tubing does not have a plastic sheath. On FAC tubing the corrugations are visible. CSST's plastic sheath covers its corrugations.
==Variants==
One type is stainless steel tubing be formed with corrugated shape on outside surface. Make it higher efficiency of heat transfer, can be used to connect the form of tube soft and flexible, with good defensive displacement and vibration and noise reduction, mainly used on heat ex-changers.
The other type is a type of conduit used for fuel gas distribution in buildings. It has a flexible corrugated stainless steel inner layer and an outer yellow or black plastic jacket. Yellow-jacketed CSST was developed first and is the most common. It has a non-conductive plastic yellow jacket. Black-jacketed CSST is relatively new. Its black jacket is electrically conductive. Manufacturer information indicates this conductive jacket dissipates the energy of indirect lightning strikes that might otherwise pierce or damage the yellow-jacketed CSST.
==Usage==
CSST is used as an alternative to the older standard “black iron” (steel) gas pipe. The inner stainless steel layer of typical residential CSST is .2 to .3 mm thick while the wall thickness of typical residential “black iron” gas pipe is 3 to 4 mm thick. CSST is more expensive than “black iron” gas pipe. However, CSST requires fewer joints, may be safer during earthquakes, and may be easier to install.
==Properties==
CSST is alleged to have an increased risk for lightning related fires. Some believe that CSST is more likely to be pierced by lightning than “black iron” pipe. There are varied opinions over CSST's fire risk and it has been involved in litigation.
==Installation==
Buildings with CSST should be inspected by experts (licensed plumbers and electricians) to verify proper bonding and installation. The CSST experts should be qualified to assure compliance with the requirements of the manufacturer and local codes. Be aware that most home inspections are not done by licensed plumbers and electricians. Building owners are advised to assure that their CSST system complies with their insurance company's requirements.
To reduce the possibility of CSST lightning damage: (1) Yellow-jacketed CSST should be bonded (connected to the electrical service panel's ground bus) at its entrance into a building. Many local codes require this. (2) All CSST should be installed away from metal objects such as metal duct work, metal pipes, electrical wiring, metal beams, or metal conduit.
CSST should not make contact with sharp objects or edges to reduce the possibility of leaks caused by piercing. For example, it should not be installed where things such as picture hanger nails or drywall screws might pierce it.

==History==
The village was probably founded in the second half of the 17th century in an inland location which is now known as 'Palio Chorio'. It was first mentioned in 1700 as 'Chora Mikri' ("small village"), as opposed to the older and larger Megali Mantineia. It had 35 families (165 people) in 1700 and 31 in 1703 which produced around 3,204 okades of oil (4,178 kg).  It became a part of the municipality of Avia in 1835.
In the early 20th century, a small part of the population moved into the nearby beach areas of 'Mourti', 'Panitsa' and 'Myloi'. It had 157 inhabitants in 1851, 183 in 1879 and 173 in 1907.  From 1914, it ran an independent community and had 177 inhabitants in 1928.  A strong earthquake damages most houses of the village in 1944. The inhabitants moved into the coastal areas. The new seaside settlement was named 'Mikri Mantineia' and the other 'Palio Chorio'.  After 1970, many new inhabitants moved into the village, and the new settlement 'Perivola' was built.
Mikri Mantineia became a part of the city of Kalamata in 1988 while Megali Mantineia joined the municipality of Avia. Although the two Mantineies are part of different municipalities, they still form one entity from the geographic, population and economic side and they have a common Olive Production Committee.

The lighthouse, surrounded by ball fields next to the new marine terminal for the Port of Paulsboro, is still active for navigation on the Delaware River. It works in conjunction with the Tinicum Front Range Light, known as the Billingsport Front Light, situated on the banks of the Delaware River at the front of Fort Billings Park next to the Paulsboro Refinery.
The lighthouse when keeper's dwelling and related structures were still in place
Front and rear range lighthouses guide sailors who, by aligning the two lights and keeping one light on top of the other, stay in its center and avoid Little Tinicum Island as they travel upstream.
The Tinicum Island Range Lights were activated on New Year's Eve 1880. They had a visible range of . The lights were changed from oil to electric in 1917. The Coast Guard automated the lights in 1933. The light tower originally had a keeper's dwelling with seven rooms, along with a brick oil house, frame barn and barnyard, cow shed, poultry house, and privy on  of land. The dwelling buildings were demolished sometime in the 1950s after they fell into disrepair.  The rear range lighthouse, which is owned by the United States Coast Guard, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 15, 2005.
Tinicum Rear Range Lighthouse Society offers regular tours, including a climb to the top of the tower, the third full weekend of each month from April through October and special tours with advance notice. Surrounding views from the lighthouse include Philadelphia and its airport.

Hartlett was drafted by Port Adelaide with pick number 4 in the 2008 AFL Draft, making him the Power's earliest draft pick ever. He is the younger brother of former Carlton forward Adam Hartlett.
==Junior career==
Hartlett toured South Africa in 2007 as part of the AIS/AFL Academy squad and represented South Australia at the 2008 AFL Under 18 Championships, earning selection in the All Australian side. Originally from Edwardstown Football Club, Hartlett was the captain of the Sacred Heart College first XVIII before he made his debut for West Adelaide in the SANFL in 2007 and has awarded the Round 16 Star Search Award nomination in his seventh senior game.
 
==AFL career==
Hartlett's 2010 season was cruelled by injury, with hamstring and quad complaints restricting the talented midfielder to just four games. He missed the start of the season through injury, but worked his way back through the SANFL to play in the Power's Round 5 win over the Saints before injury struck the following week. He managed two more games for the year, but it was decided after the break to rest him for the remainder of the year. Hartlett was sent to Europe for further treatment on his troublesome hamstring
In 2011 Hartlett overcame shoulder surgery to return to the Power side for Round 3 and was then able to string 16 consecutive games together averaging 20.8 disposals per game – his best run in the AFL. In his most consistent year for the club to date, Hartlett finished seventh in the John Cahill Medal and was awarded the Gavin Wanganeen Medal as the club's best rising talent. He spent more time in the midfield later in the year and this saw an increase in his productivity, including a 32 disposal game against St Kilda in Round 16. His season was cut short after Round 20 when he was forced to undergo shoulder surgery. He finished the season fifth in total kicks for the club
Hartlett started the 2012 season with a best on ground performance in the Power's narrow win over the Saints in Round 1. He had 26 disposals and kicked a vital goal playing across half back. His early season form was solid, but he struggled to have the impact on games. He continued to mix his time between half back and the midfield. His best performance of the year came in Round 10 against Carlton, when Hartlett received the three Brownlow votes for 26 disposals and three raking goals from outside 50m. Hartlett's season was derailed in Round 12 when he suffered a hamstring tear, which kept him out until Round 19. He played two matches before being suspended for two weeks for contact with Hawthorn's Cyril Rioli. Hartlett finished the season ranked sixth at the club for average disposals and fourth for total tackles
Season 2014 was considered a breakout season for Hartlett where played the majority of the season in the midfield, averaging 21 disposals and kicking 21 goals. His field kicking was consistently damaging. His best performances of the season were a Showdown medal winning game against the Crows in round 2 and an important semi final performance where he racked up a team high 33 disposals.
However, in 2015, Hartlett had an up and down season. He was often serviceable in his role across half back and pushing up to the wing but seemed to be less damaging, particularly with his kicking inside 50. His tally of 9 goals was well short of his 21 from 2014. He did however record a personal best for disposals in a season and played every game for the first time in his too often injury interrupted career.
For the 2016 season, Hartlett was announced as the vice-captain of the club to captain Travis Boak.

He developed training materials aimed to help employers integrate persons with disabilities into the workplace.
Pimentel was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, by his grandmother, as his mother was mentally ill. He lost the majority of his hearing while serving in the Vietnam War, returning to the United States in 1970 almost entirely deaf. He attempted to apply for a rehabilitation program for veterans, but was denied by the Veterans Administration, marking the beginning of a battle with the Administration in order to allow his admittance to Portland State University.
His life story is recounted in the 2007 film 'Music Within'. He is a senior partner of Milt Wright & Associates, Inc.
==Early life==
Pimentel was born in Portland, Oregon. His mother was mentally ill, his father died in Richard's childhood, he temporarily stayed in a local orphanage, and was mainly raised by his grandmother. He graduated from Jefferson High School in Portland, Oregon, then enlisted in the U.S. Army, was deployed to Vietnam War, and returned 1970 almost completely deaf. He enrolled in a vocational rehabilitation program for veterans but, based on his deafness, the Veterans Administration declined his application to help him become a professional speaker. With support by the university's Speech and Hearing Department's professor and College Bowl founder Ben Padrow, Pimentel finally received a veteran rehabilitation grant to enroll at Portland State University.
==Career==
Starting as a sociology class project at the university, Pimentel developed a training program for supervisors on disability issues to see if that would increase job placements of disabled people.
In 1981, he authored the disability attitude training 'Tilting at Windmills Training Program' ('Windmills') to help employers hire more people with disabilities.
Since then he trained tens of thousands of workers, supervisors, managers, and representatives of US government agencies and Fortune 500 companies on disability awareness and sensitivity, disability management, and return-to-work models for injured and recently disabled employees.
Commissioned by the President's Committee on Employment of Persons with Disabilities, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and the National Institute of Health (NIH), Pimentel co-authored 'AIDS in the Workplace' in 1988. This attitudinal training program aimed to reduce congressional resistance to AIDS being covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
Shortly after the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was signed into law in 1990, the chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission publicly thanked Pimentel for educating employers on disability issues.
Beginning in 1997, Pimentel developed training material and acted as keynote speaker for the Marriott Foundation for People with Disabilities. The foundation's 'Bridges' program helped placing 1,200 young people with disabilities into employment each year.
Pimentel started in 2008 with designing and implementing a training program for the employers of disabled veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan focusing on PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.
Also in 2008, the Portland State University awarded Richard Pimentel an Honorary Doctorate in Humanities.
According to Milt Wright & Associates' website, Pimentel has been the Chairperson of VACOR, the Department of Veterans Affairs' Civilian Advisory Committee for Rehabilitation.
==In culture==
Warner Bros. released in 2007 the full-length motion picture 'Music Within' based on Pimentel's life story, starring Ron Livingston as Richard Pimentel and Michael Sheen as Art Honeyman.

The Dolphins improved upon their previous season's output of 6–8, winning ten games. After suffering their first losing season under Coach Don Shula, the Dolphins bounced back to finish 10-4. Bob Griese had a stellar year, despite being forced to wear thick eyeglasses due to a problem with his contacts. Griese, whose season was highlighted by a six touchdown game in St. Louis against the Cardinals, was named Player of the year by the Maxwell Club of Philadelphia. Despite the improvement, the team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the third straight season.

==References==Lucy B. Walford
'Lucy Bethia (Colquhoun) Walford' (17 April 1845 – 11 May 1915) was a Scottish novelist and artist, who wrote 45 books, the majority of them "light-hearted domestic comedies". Accurate writing was a big consideration for her.
==Life==
Walford was born Lucy Bethia Colquhoun on 17 April 1845 at Portobello, a seaside resort near Edinburgh, the seventh child of Frances Sarah Fuller Maitland (1813–1877), a poet and hymn writer and John Colquhoun (1805–1885) of Luss, Dunbartonshire, author of 'The Moor and the Loch'. Her paternal grandmother, Janet Colquhoun (1781–1846), was a religious writer, and her aunt, Catherine Sinclair (1800–1864) was a prolific novelist and children's writer.
Walford was educated privately by German governesses. Her reading included works by Charlotte Mary Yonge and Susan Ferrier, and in later years Jane Austen. The family moved to Edinburgh in 1855, where guests included the artist Noël Paton, who encouraged her to take up painting. In 1868 and several succeeding years she exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Royal Scottish Academy. Her first short piece of writing appeared in the 'Sunday Magazine' in May 1869.
On 23 June 1869 she married Alfred Saunders Walford (d. 1907), a magistrate of Ilford, Essex, and they moved to London. They had five daughters and two sons. Their children were said to be "never put aside for her work" and "constantly with their mother."  She died on 11 May 1915 at her home in Pimlico, London.
==Works==
When writing, she would seek to be as accurate as possible. Her brothers were sought out to answer any questions she had on military life. Her father was an expert on sports. The protagonist of her first novel, 'Mr Smith: a Part of his Life' (1874) was taken from an actual man named Smith who was found dead, as described in her novel. It pleased Queen Victoria and led to her being received at court. It was also admired by Coventry Patmore. By the age of 65 Walford had written 45 full-length novels, including 'Pauline' (1877), 'The Baby's Grandmother' (1884), 'Stiff Necked Generation' (1889), and 'The Havoc of a Smile' (1890). She also wrote for London journals. Her last novel, 'David and Jonathan on the Riviera', appeared in 1914.

*'Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza' (27 January 187513 July 1942) was a Mexican anarchist and feminist activist, typographer, journalist and poet
==Biography==
She born in San Juan del Río, Durango, 27 January 1875. While many women contributed in the Mexican Revolution 1910-1920 by fighting alongside their husbands, others wrote against the injustices of the Díaz regime. In May 1901 she founded an anti-Díaz newspaper called 'Vésper'. She attacked the clergy in Guanajuato and wrote against foreign domination in Mexico. She also wrote against the Díaz regime and criticized Díaz for not carrying out the requests and needs of the  people. As a result, her newspaper was confiscated and she was also put in jail several times by Díaz between 1904 and 1920. She established a new newspaper called 'El Desmonte' (1900-1919) and continued her writings. She encouraged workers and peasants to vote as she wrote “not to integrate power, but to disintegrate it, as a means of forming, not a new oligarchy but of transforming the oligarchies into truly public administrations.” She argued that the Mexican Population could not count on the leadership of political parties given that they wanted to obtain office in order to protect their own interests. To propagate liberation ideology throughout Mexico, Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza translated the works of Peter Kropotkin, Mikhail Bakunin, and Pierre Joseph Proudhon to Spanish.  Even though she was intimidated throughout her life, she continued writing and educating the public on the injustices the different governments brought upon Mexico. She is one of the many intellectuals who contributed with her writings to the Mexican Revolution.
She was also a Caxcan Indian from the state of Durango.

'Ravensworth' was an 18th-century plantation house near Annandale in Fairfax County, Virginia. Ravensworth was the Northern Virginia residence of William Fitzhugh, William Henry Fitzhugh, Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis, William Henry Fitzhugh Lee and George Washington Custis Lee. It was built in 1796.
==Location==
Ravensworth was located near Annandale, Virginia, south of Braddock Road, west of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495).
==History==
It was one of three mansions built on the large Ravensworth land grant; the other two were Ossian Hall and Oak Hill.  William Fitzhugh had also purchased a townhouse in Alexandria at 607 Oronoco Street in 1799, which his family – in 1818 – lent to their cousin, Anne Hill Carter Lee, widow of Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee, and her eleven-year-old son, Robert Edward.  Eleven years later, on 26 July 1829, Anne Hill Carter Lee died at Ravensworth.
Historic markers along the road in front of the Ravensworth Shopping Center describe the history of Ravensworth estate.
William Fitzhugh died and was buried there in 1809.
Ravensworth then passed to Fitzhugh's son William Henry Fitzhugh, who died in 1830. William Henry Fitzhugh's childless widow, Anna Maria Sarah Goldsborough Fitzhugh, ran the estate until her death in 1874.
William Fitzhugh and Ann Bolling Randolph's daughter Mary Lee Fitzhugh married George Washington Parke Custis (Martha Washington's grandson) and became the mistress of Arlington House.  Their grandson, Confederate general William Henry Fitzhugh "Rooney" Lee, inherited Ravensworth after the death of his great-aunt and lived there from 1874 until his death in 1891.  In 1897 George Washington Custis Lee moved to Ravensworth after resigning as president of Washington and Lee University and lived there until his death in 1913.
When Mary Anna Custis Lee fled Arlington House in May 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War, she stayed at Ravensworth briefly, but then moved further south for fear of inviting damage to the home.  Both Union and Confederate forces took advantage of resources and location at Ravensworth; during 1863, in addition to Union forces foraging hay, partisan forces commanded by John S. Mosby once slept in a haystack there and at daybreak discovered they were in full view of a Union encampment.  All three of the Fitzhugh estates were protected by orders from both sides throughout the war.
The house mysteriously burned on 1 August 1926.
In 1957, Dr. George Bolling Lee's widow sold the estate for development. That same year the remains from the Fitzhugh family cemetery, including those of William Fitzhugh and his wife, were removed and reinterred at the cemetery of Pohick Church in Lorton. The grounds later became the Ravensworth Farm subdivision, which today is a census-designated place also called Ravensworth. The locality's population as of the 2010 census was 2,466.

==References=='Elza Cansanção Medeiros', popularly known as 'Major Elza' (October 21, 1921 – December 8, 2009), was a Brazilian Army officer and World War II veteran. She was the highest-ranking female officer in the Brazilian Army with the rank of Major, having deployed to Italy during the war along with the Brazilian Expeditionary Force as a nurse. Medeiros used to lecture about the Brazilian participation in World War II.
==Biography==
Medeiros was born in Rio de Janeiro on October 21, 1921, the daughter of sanitary doctor Tadeu de Araújo Medeiros—a friend of Alberto Santos Dumont and direct assistant of Oswaldo Cruz in the campaign against yellow fever. At the age of nineteen, she was the first Brazilian to volunteer in the Army Health Directorate to serve in World War II. Although she dreamed of fighting on the front line, she had to settle for being one of the seventy-three nurses in the Precursor Health Detachment of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, since the Brazilian Army at the time did not accept female combatants.
With her parents, from Alagoas, she learned to shoot, still in her teens. With the German housekeepers who served their family in the 1930s Copacabana, she learned Music and languages. By appointment of Arnon de Mello, father of President Fernando Collor de Mello, she joined the Brazilian Press Association. It premiered, with Fernando Torres, Nathalia Timberg and Sérgio Brito at the University Theater, with the play 'Dama da Madrugada'. She graduated from the School of Nursing at the Red Cross. She graduated in Journalism from the National Faculty of Philosophy.
Her service in World War II began in Alagoas, providing relief to the shipwrecked Itapagé, torpedoed on the Brazilian coast by the German submarine U-161 commanded by Captain Albrecht Achilles.
During the conflict, she worked in evacuation hospitals in Italy, far from the front, in twelve-hour shifts, no soldier having died in her arms. She served as Liaison Officer and Chief Nurse at the 7th Station Hospital in Livorno. With the end of the conflict, she was dismissed shortly after returning to the country, and became an employee for Banco do Brasil.
In 1957, the women were reconvened and could join the military; Medeiros promptly returned to her nurse duties. Despite working for the National Intelligence Service of Brazil (SNI), she never considered abandoning her military career.
She graduated in journalism, history of the Americas, psychology, parapsychology, tourism and human relations. With knowledge of mechanics, sculpture, painting and tapestry, Medeiros traveled the world twice, having been to the Antarctic continent. She learned to fly ultralight aircraft at the age of sixty.
"Major Elza" founded and directed two magazines and signed several columns in newspapers from Rio de Janeiro and Recife, having written three books on her participation in World War II. She also presented numerous papers at military medicine congresses, with special emphasis on suggestions for the creation of a Women's Auxiliary Corps for the Armed Forces, the basis for opening the Brazilian Armed Forces to women's participation.
A member of the Alagoas Academy of Culture, she also worked towards the preservation of FEB's photographic memory.
Elza Cansanção Medeiros died on December 8, 2009, in her hometown of Rio de Janeiro.

From 2008 to 2009 and from 2013 until 2017, he was a member of the National Assembly, representing the Hauts-de-Seine department. He is also the founder of l'Ame Nord, a non-profit organization dedicated to serve the interests of French residents living in the US and Canada.
==Political career==
Lefebvre was first elected to the National Assembly in the 2007 elections. In parliament, he served on the Finance Committee from 2007 until 2009. In 2008, he introduced an amendment to President Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration law to allow illegal foreign employees to apply for work permits if their employers can show they are important to the economy. 
Lefebvre was the UMP's candidate in the for First constituency for French residents overseas (for French expatriates in Canada and the United States) in the 2012 legislative election, but lost against Corinne Narassiguin, who received 54.01% of the votes. On 15 February 2013, the Constitutional Council canceled the election and said Corinne Narassiguin ineligible. He topped the first round of the early parliamentary elections, and after the second round, 9 June 2013, he was elected against the Socialist candidate, Frank Scemama, with 53.72% of the vote. He subsequently served on the Defence Committee from 2013 until 2017.
Lefebvre was a candidate in the 2016 Republican presidential primary.
In the 2017 elections, Lefebvre lost his re-election race against Roland Lescure, the candidate of La République En Marche! (LREM); Lescure won 80 percent of the vote, to Lefebvre's 20 percent. 
In November 2017, Lefebvre was among the co-founders of Agir and served as the party's vice-chairman. In 2019, however, he joined LREM.

Alexander, who had no navy, was constantly being threatened by the Persian navy. It continuously attempted to provoke an engagement with Alexander, who would not oblige them. Eventually, the Persian fleet sailed to Halicarnassus, in order to establish a new defense. Ada of Caria, the former queen of Halicarnassus, had been driven from her throne by her younger brother Pixodarus of Caria. When Pixodarus died, Persian King Darius had appointed Orontobates satrap of Caria, which included Halicarnassus in its jurisdiction. On the arrival of Alexander in 334 BC, Ada, who was in possession of the fortress of Alinda, surrendered the fortress to him.
Orontobates and Memnon of Rhodes entrenched themselves in Halicarnassus. Alexander had sent spies to meet with dissidents inside the city, who had promised to open the gates and allow Alexander to enter. When his spies arrived, however, the dissidents were nowhere to be found. A small battle resulted, and Alexander's army managed to break through the city walls. Memnon, however, now deployed his catapults, and Alexander's army fell back. Memnon then deployed his infantry, and shortly before Alexander would have received his first defeat, his infantry managed to break through the city walls, surprising the Persian forces. Memnon, realizing the city was lost, set fire to it and withdrew with his army. Strong winds caused the fire to destroy much of the city.
Alexander committed the government of Caria to Ada; and she, in turn, formally adopted Alexander as her son, ensuring that the rule of Caria passed unconditionally to him upon her eventual death. During her husband's tenure as satrap, Ada had been loved by the people of Caria. By putting Ada, who felt very favorably towards Alexander, on the throne, he ensured that the government of Caria, as well as its people, remained loyal to him.

'James Henry Apperley Tremenheere' (30 October 1853 – 28 October 1912) was an Indian-born English colonial official and cricketer. His report recommended that the British government should allot lands for the Scheduled Castes to overcome the social discrimination they faced. These lands were later identified as Depressed Class condition lands (பஞ்சமி நிலம்).
==Life==
He was the son of Charles William Tremenheere. He was born in Poona, and educated in England at Lancing College, where he played cricket for the school.
He passed the entry examination for the Indian Civil Service in 1873, and completed his training in 1875. He arrived in India in November 1875, and worked first in Madras. He was moved to Mysore in 1883, but was later returned to Madras.
In 1891 Tremenheere was Collector for Chingleput, and reported on the depressed castes, at a time of local famine. He described the poor condition of a group of Paraiyars at Senneri. He suggested improving their position with respect to land ownership. He took into account the report of his predecessor, Lee Warner, and attributed the social problem he met to the 'mirasi' system. The report's conclusions, however, were resisted by the Board of Revenue. Tremenheere became Collector and magistrate at Kistna in 1894. He was appointed Collector for the Niligris in 1896.
Tremenheere retired in 1901. He died in Scotland, at Inglismaldie Castle in Edzell and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.
==Cricket==
J.H.A. Tremenheere with his teammates in Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 1872
J.H.A. Tremenheere was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm round-arm medium pace bowler who played for Gloucestershire. He made a single first-class appearance, during the 1872 season, aged just 18, against Surrey. From the lower order, he scored 7 runs in the only innings in which he batted, as his team secured a win by an innings margin.

==Notes==The 'Panamanian night monkey' or 'Chocoan night monkey' ('Aotus zonalis') is a species of night monkey formerly considered a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey of the family Aotidae. Its range consists of Panama and the Chocó region of Colombia.  There are also unconfirmed reports of its occurrence in Costa Rica, especially on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica.  The species definitely occurs in the Atlantic lowlands of Panama close to the Costa Rica border.
The exact classification of the Panamanian Night Monkey is uncertain. While some authors consider it a subspecies of the gray-bellied night monkey, 'A. lemurinus', other authors follow a study by Thomas Defler from 2001, which concluded that it is a separate species, 'A. zonalis'.
The Panamanian night monkey is a relatively small monkey, with males weighing approximately  and females weighing about .  The fur on the back ranges from grayish brown to reddish brown.  The belly is yellow.  The hair on the back of the hands and feet is black or dark brown, which is a key distinguishing feature from other northern "gray-necked" 'Aotus' species; also, its hair is shorter.  Other distinguishing features relate to its skull, which has a broad braincase, a depressed interorbital region, and large molariform teeth.
Like other night monkeys, the Panamanian night monkey has large eyes, befitting its nocturnal lifestyle.  But unlike many nocturnal animal species, its eyes do not have a tapetum lucidum. Also like other night monkeys, it has a short tail relative to the body size.
The Panamanian night monkey is arboreal and nocturnal.  It and the other members of the genus 'Aotus' are the only nocturnal monkeys.  It is found in several types of forest, including secondary forest and coffee plantations.  It lives in small groups of between two and six monkeys, consisting of an adult pair and one infant and several juveniles and/or subadults.  Groups are territorial, and groups occupy ranges that overlap only slightly.
Vocal, olfactory and behavioral forms of communication have all been recorded.  At least nine vocal calls have been reported, including various types of grunts, screams, squeals, moans and trills.  Males develop a scent gland near their tail at the age of about one year that is used for scent marking. Urine washing, in which urine is rubbed on the hands and feet, is also used.  Behavioral communication appears to be less important than vocal and olfactory communication, but certain behavioral displays, including arched back displays, stiff legged jumping, urination, defecation and piloerection have been noted.
The Panamanian night monkey generally walks on all four legs, although it is capable of leaping or running when necessary.  It eats a variety of foods.  In one study, on Barro Colorado Island in Panama, its diet was found to consist of 65% fruits, 30% leaves and 5% insects.
In common with other night monkeys, the Panamanian night monkey is one of the few monogamous monkeys.  The monogamous pair generally gives birth to a single infant each year, although twins occasionally occur.  The gestation period is about 133 days.  The father carries the infant from the time it is one or two days old, passing it to the mother for nursing.
Although viewing monkeys is popular with tourists visiting Panama, the Panamanian night monkey's nocturnal habits make it less often seen than the other Panamanian monkey species. However, with a skilled guide it is possible to observe the Panamanian night monkey.
==References==The 'Lax–Friedrichs method', named after Peter Lax and Kurt O. Friedrichs, is a numerical method for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations based on finite differences.  The method can be described as the FTCS (forward in time, centered in space) scheme with a numerical dissipation term of 1/2.  One can view the Lax–Friedrichs method as an alternative to Godunov's scheme, where one avoids solving a Riemann problem at each cell interface, at the expense of adding artificial viscosity.
==Illustration for a Linear Problem==
Consider a one-dimensional, linear hyperbolic partial differential equation for  of the form:
: 
on the domain
: 
with initial condition
: 
and the boundary conditions
:  
: 
If one discretizes the domain  to a grid with equally spaced points with a spacing of  in the -direction and  in the -direction, we define 
:  
where 
:  
are integers representing the number of grid intervals.  Then the Lax–Friedrichs method for solving the above partial differential equation is given by:
: 
Or, rewriting this to solve for the unknown 
: 
Where the initial values and boundary nodes are taken from
: 
: 
: 
== Extensions to Nonlinear Problems ==
A nonlinear hyperbolic conservation law is defined through a flux function :
: 
In the case of , we end up with a scalar linear problem.  Note that in general,  is a vector with  equations in it.
The generalization of the Lax-Friedrichs method to nonlinear systems takes the form
: 
This method is conservative and first order accurate, hence quite dissipative.  It can, however be used as a building block for building high-order numerical schemes for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations, much like Euler time steps can be used as a building block for creating high-order numerical integrators for ordinary differential equations.
We note that this method can be written in conservation form:
:
where
:
Without the extra terms  and   in the discrete flux, , one ends up with the FTCS scheme, which is well known to be unconditionally unstable for hyperbolic problems.
==Stability and accuracy==
 Example problem initial condition
 Lax-Friedrichs solution
This method is explicit and first order accurate in time and first order accurate in space (  provided  are sufficiently-smooth functions.   Under these conditions, the method is stable if and only if the following condition is satisfied:
:
(A von Neumann stability analysis can show the necessity of this stability condition.)  The Lax–Friedrichs method is classified as having second-order dissipation and third order dispersion . For functions that have discontinuities, the scheme displays strong dissipation and dispersion ; see figures at right.

Its last assignment was with the Air Defense Command San Francisco Air Defense Sector stationed at Oxnard Air Force Base, California. It was inactivated on 18 July 1968.
==History==
===World War II===
It was established in late 1944 as a very long range Republic P-47N Thunderbolt fighter squadron. It trained under III Fighter Command. The 456th was deployed to Pacific Theater of Operations, and assigned to XXI Bomber Command as a long-range escort squadron for B-29 Superfortress bombers engaged in the strategic bombardment of Japan, based on Iwo Jima.   After the Japanese capitulation, it was moved to Luzon where the squadron was demobilized; the P-47Ns were returned to storage depots in the United States. It was inactivated as a paper unit in 1946.
===Cold War Air Defense===
456th FIS North American F-86L Sabres at Castle AFB, California, February 1958
It was reactivated in 1954 under Air Defense Command as an air defense interceptor squadron, and stationed at Truax Field, Wisconsin for the air defense of the Great Lakes. It was equipped with North American F-86D Sabres.  In August 1955 the unit was inactivated, and was reactivated at Castle Air Force Base, California in October 1955 with North American F-86D Sabres.  In 1957 it began re-equipping with the North American North American F-86L Sabre, an improved version of the F-86D which incorporated the Semi Automatic Ground Environment, or SAGE computer-controlled direction system for intercepts.  The service of the F-86L was brief, since by the time the last F-86L conversion was delivered, the type was already being phased out in favor of supersonic interceptors.
Squadron F-106A Delta Dart
The squadron upgraded in June 1958 into supersonic Convair F-102A Delta Daggers.  In September 1959 it received Convair F-106 Delta Darts.
On 22 October 1962, before President John F. Kennedy told Americans that missiles were in place in Cuba, the squadron dispersed one third of its force, equipped with nuclear tipped missiles to Fresno Air Terminal at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis. These planes returned to Castle after the crisis.
The squadron moved to Oxnard Air Force Base, California on 18 July 1968 and was inactivated the same day, transferring its mission, personnel and equipment to the 437th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.

==Club career==
===Bordeaux===
Born in Brétigny-sur-Orge, Essonne of Croatian descent, Sertic joined FC Girondins de Bordeaux's youth system at the age of 15, from the famed Clairefontaine academy. During the 2007–08 season, spent in the Championnat de France Amateur with the senior reserves, he earned praise from first team manager Laurent Blanc.
Sertic made his debut in Ligue 1 on 29 April 2009, starting in a 2–3 away win against Stade Rennais FC. His maiden competitive appearance had taken place on 11 November of the previous year, in the 4–2 home victory over En Avant de Guingamp for the round of 16 of the Coupe de la Ligue where he came on as a late substitute; his first goal in the former competition was scored in only his second appearance, helping the hosts defeat FC Sochaux-Montbéliard 3–0.
For the 2010–11 season, Sertic was loaned to fellow league club RC Lens.
===Marseille===
On 30 January 2017, Sertic signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Olympique de Marseille. During his spell at the 'Stade Vélodrome', he played sparingly due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. 
In February 2019, Sertic moved to FC Zürich of the Swiss Super League until the end of the season.
==International career==
On 25 May 2009, Sertic was called up for the first time to the France under-21 side which was due to participate in that year's Toulon Tournament. He made his debut in the competition on 6 June, playing 36 minutes in the 1–0 group stage defeat of Portugal.
Sertic was granted Croatian citizenship in March 2013, as his paternal grandfather was a native of Brinje who moved to the French capital. However, FIFA did not allow him to play for that national team due to new rules about naturalisation of players.

I'll just note that my one brief experience in soliciting interviews
online was rather troubled (see below). Fortunately, for practical and
theoretical reasons I preferred making use of public practice and
discussion. In any case, should I need to do so again, the best
"interviews" I did make were by going to F2F meetings and connecting
with Wikipedians. This isn't a random or representative sample of
course.
 http://reagle.org/joseph/2005/ethno/leadership.html
On a suggestion, I developed a brief questionnaire to engage with
editors of the Harry Potter Project pages but, as expected, received
few responses. Open content communities are, presently, often studied
(with similar questionnaires) and participants might have little
interest in taking time away from their actual (volunteer) work to
respond to yet another. (As a participant, I have never responded to
such a questionnaire.) Contacting actual participants can be difficult
as well, as Lorenzon (2005) noted: "Many editors have their own user
page which give information about them but few give out their real
names and contact information." I made my solicitation on the Talk
page for the Project as well as the Talk pages of a handful of
prominent editors, without much success. Additionally, because most
all the discourse is public and the community is otherwise so
reflective, there is an abundance of existing data situated in actual
practice. This is not to say such research discussions are not useful;
once I developed my questions I was interested in receiving answers
and the single response was informative. Fortunately, while responses
to questionnaires can be hard to obtain, I also do not think them
necessary to understand this community. Instead, one must follow (or

The University of Plano received its charter from the State of Texas on May 8, 1964 as a private, coeducational, nondenominational institution. The school was originally called the University of Lebanon, changing its name effective September 4, 1964 to reflect the location of its campus. The university's first classes were held in space leased in downtown Dallas in the fall of 1965.
The school was founded in 1964 by Robert J. Morris, an attorney and former judge known as an anti-Communist. Morris had served as chief counsel the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. Morris had been the president of the University of Dallas from 1960 to 1962. Dr. Morris was committed to building a high-caliber, world-class, liberal arts university with a politically conservative posture.  His concept and vision attracted highly distinguished professors and staff from around the country. Donald G. Scott was the school's president. He remained at the school until 1977 and it closed permanently shortly thereafter.
Building on the learning challenges faced by one of his children, Morris founded the school in 1964 with a focus on the education of college-age students with the addition of non-traditional learning techniques from the Doman-Delacato Method, that were intended to stimulate brain development. Dr. Morris was also personally committed to students that had suffered injuries that impaired their physical articulation.  Incorporated into the foundation of the University was the School of Neurological Organization (NO) focusing on the exceptional Doman-Delacato methodology. While the programs Dr. Glen Doman and Dr. Carl Delacto developed were ostensibly for treatment of those suffering with an autistic diagnosis, they and Dr. Morris were confident that this program would be instrumental in helping and aiding the recovery of those with mild brain or nervous system damage that resulted from accidental occurrences.  Dr. Morris' ultimate goal was to both found a world-class university AND provide a unique environment where injured youths could be rehabilitated from their physical injuries while concurrently being otherwise able to participate in a superior curriculum of collegiate learning.  Dr. Morris' ingenuity pre-dated the now-popular concept of main-streaming those with brain injuries.
Using $250,000 borrowed from Republic National Life of Dallas, he put a down payment on  of land in northwest Plano. With $600,000 raised from a bond issue, he persuaded the government of Malaysia to donate to the school the nation's pavilion from the 1964 New York World's Fair, with the pagoda becoming the main building of the university.
The school had no endowment to speak of, other than the land where its campus was located on Custer Road. The school's finances depended on rising values for the land it had purchased, based on the assumption that the growth of the Dallas area would push residential development towards Plano and hopes that portions of the land could be rezoned for commercial use, both of which would drive up the value of the land. Property purchased by Morris for the University in 1964 for $1,800 an acre, sold in 1969 for $3,000 an acre, and could obtain as much as $6,300 an acre by 1971.  of the school's land was rezoned for a shopping center and an additional  was rezoned for small retail.
Despite warnings offered as far back as 1967, the school developed a heavy reliance on land speculation to meet its expenses. With the end of the land boom in 1975, the school was unable to use land sales to fund its activities. The school ran short of funds in 1976, and despite ownership of  and twenty buildings, was forced to close in July 1976.
Records from the former University are not complete and many are not available as they were privately held by Dr. Robert Morris for some time. The chain of custody is unclear and many graduates have been unable to recover records. An alumni site was available at Universityofplano.org. Though still registered as of June 2017, the site only has a parking redirect link from GoDaddy.com.

The '1977 New Orleans Saints season' was the team's eleventh as a member of the National Football League. They were unable to improve on their previous season's output of 4–10, winning only three games. The team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the eleventh consecutive season, while coach Hank Stram was fired following the season. In his two seasons as coach the Saints only won seven games.

The first victory overall for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, did not come until week 13 on the road against the Saints, almost two seasons after their first game against the Houston Oilers in 1976. The Bucs led at halftime by a score of 13–0. Dave Green had two field goals, while Gary Huff threw a touchdown pass to Morris Owens. Upon their arrival to Tampa Bay, the Bucs were greeted by 8,000 fans.
The Saints were 11-point favorites before the game, and fans booed as the Buccaneers scored. "Eleven years I've supported this franchise!" one shouted, adding, "With all this money I've spent on this lousy team I could have bought some land in Colombia and raised pot". Losing to a team with a 0-26 losing streak was so humiliating that safety Tom Myers said, "We've been made the laughingstocks of the business ... I'm too embarrassed to say that I play for the team that got beat by Tampa Bay". Said head coach Hank Stram, "We're all very ashamed of what happened today. Ashamed for our people, for our fans, the organization, everybody. It is my worst coaching experience". Team owner John Mecom said during the loss that the Saints "is a poorly coached team", and Stram was fired January 28, 1978.

Before a CBS TV Regional Audience, Atlanta, which had never given up more than 14 points in a game this year, tried to keep it that way with one minute to go - In New Orleans - And Archie Manning was waiting. The Saints quarterback, back in action for the first time in six weeks, read the blitz and beat it with a 18-yard TD Pass, his second scoring strike to tight end Henry Childs. It was Hank Stram's 136th victory as a head coach... and his last.

== References ==The 'Ponca Reservation' of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska is located in northeast Nebraska, with the seat of tribal government located in Niobrara, Knox County. The Indian reservation is also the location of the historic Ponca Fort called 'Nanza'. The Ponca tribe does not actually have a reservation because the state of Nebraska will not allow them to have one. However, they do in fact have a 15-county service delivery area, including counties spread throughout Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa.
Established by a treaty dated March 12, 1858 and a supplemental treaty on March 10, 1865, the reservation was re-established by an Act of Congress dated March 2, 1899. There were  allotted to 167 Indians for settlement. An Indian agency and school buildings were reserved .
== History ==
Despite their original reservation having been established in 1858, the Ponca suffered decades of broken treaties, a lack of financial support from the U.S. Government, and ongoing attacks by the neighboring Sioux, with whom they were sworn enemies.  In 1875 a Ponca agent visited President Ulysses S. Grant to discuss moving the Ponca to the Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. Grant agreed to the move if the Ponca were willing.  When the agent returned to Nebraska, Standing Bear and other tribal members signed an agreement to move to the Indian Territory. The agreement also allowed several Ponca chiefs to select a new reservation there. In 1877 the Ponca leaders made arrangements to visit the Indian Territory and select a site for a new reservation.
=== Ponca Trail of Tears ===
In early 1877, ten Ponca leaders left for the Osage Reservation in Indian Territory to select a site for the new Ponca Reservation. Upon arriving, they found no Osage leaders present, so no land agreements were signed. Standing Bear and the other leaders decided they wanted to return home, which infuriated the Indian agent who accompanied them. In February the group of chiefs decided to return on their own. The group spent much of their travels on the open prairie, going for days without rations. They arrived at the Ponca Reservation more than three months later in April 1877.
On their arrival, the group met with their Indian Agent, who had orders to remove the tribe by force to Oklahoma. The tribe was split about leaving; those willing left in mid-April. A month later Standing Bear and the remainder of the tribe left after a military unit from Fort Omaha arrived. Nine people died on the journey, including Standing Bear's daughter.  Prairie Flower died of consumption and was buried at Milford, Nebraska. White Buffalo Girl, daughter of Black Elk and Moon Hawk, also died and was buried near Neligh, Nebraska, with the people of Neligh providing a Christian burial for the girl and crafting an oak cross over the gravesite. Black Elk asked that the grave of his daughter be honored, and in 1913 the town of Neligh erected a marble monument that is still there.
Several of the leaders of the tribe went back to Nebraska, only to be imprisoned at Fort Omaha. General George Crook, commander of the Department of the Platte, imprisoned the contingent against his own best concerns. He tipped off Thomas Tibbles of the 'Omaha Daily Herald', who brought national attention to the plight of the tribe. This eventually led the U.S. government to grant the tribe two reservations; one in Nebraska and one in Oklahoma.

== Biography ==
Born in Madrid, Spain, Moreno was the daughter of Spanish character actor Francisco Moreno, who also developed a Hollywood career. As a child she devoted herself to acting in revue and zarzuela genres.
Moreno appeared in more than 30 films in a career that spanned more than 20 years, often travelling through several countries in quick succession. She made her screen debut alongside her father in the 1930 film 'Amor audaz', co-starring Adolphe Menjou. The same year she appeared in the Spanish-language version of 'Paramount on Parade', released by Paramount Pictures. In 1931, she co-starred in 'Stamboul', released by Paramount British. In 1935, Moreno paired with Carlos Gardel in two significant films, 'El día que me quieras' and 'Tango Bar'. The same year, she was selected for the main role in 'Piernas de seda'.
She also worked with Richard Arlen ('The Santa Fe Trail', 1930), Clara Bow ('Her Wedding Night', 1930), Cary Grant ('Ladies Should Listen', 1934), and Noël Coward ('The Scoundrel', 1935), among others.
She made her last appearance in 1949 in an episode of 'The Clock', a suspense/anthology TV-series based on an ABC Radio Network series which ran from 1946 through 1948. In this episode she shared leading roles with George Reeves. Little is known about her after that point.
Rosita Moreno died in 1993 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, at the age of 86 from undisclosed causes.

*The 'Winnebago Reservation' of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska is located in Thurston County, Nebraska, United States. The tribal council offices are located in the town of Winnebago. The villages of Emerson, south of First Street, as well as Thurston, are also located on the reservation. The reservation occupies northern Thurston County, Nebraska, as well as southeastern Dixon County and Woodbury County, Iowa, and a small plot of off-reservation land of southern Craig Township in Burt County, Nebraska. The other federally recognized Winnebago tribe is Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin, whose reservation is primarily in that state.
==Early history==
Established by an Act of Congress dated February 21, 1863, the reservation was reaffirmed by a treaty dated March 8, 1865 and an act of June 22, 1874. The land was deeded from the Omaha tribe on July 31, 1874.  were allotted to 1,200 Indians;  reserved for agency, etc.; the residue, , is unallotted.
==Economic development==
Location of the Winnebago Reservation in Nebraska
In 1992 the federally recognized tribe established the WinnaVegas Casino to generate revenues and provide employment. Its council had already legalized alcohol sales on the reservation, in order to keep the revenues from sales taxes and associated fees that its residents had previously paid through off-reservation merchants to the state. It also now directly regulates the sales and can provide for treatment for individuals and families affected by alcoholism. As of 2007, 63% of federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states had legalized alcohol sales for similar reasons.
In 1994, based on a long-term view of growth, the tribe founded Ho-Chunk, Inc., its economic development corporation, which has strongly contributed to new resources on the reservation. Beginning with one employee, it has grown to 1400 employees operating in 10 states and five foreign countries. Its revenues have provided for development in 1995 of Little Priest Tribal College; as well as a new community school, hospital and a strong housing construction program of more than $1 million, with development of Ho-Chunk Village.
The rise in its economy has enabled the tribe to improve the quality of life on the reservation, as Lance Morgan, the CEO of the corporation, discussed in a forum at Bellevue University in Omaha, Nebraska on April 2, 2010. Ho-Chunk, Inc. has gained awards for small business, and it has initiated a strong housing construction program in collaboration with federal programs. Its leaders were featured on 'Native American Entrepreneurs', airing in 2009 on PBS. Ho-Chunk, Inc. operates 26 subsidiaries in areas such as information technology, construction, government contracting, green energy, retail, wholesale distribution, marketing, media and transportation.

On his way home to Chicago to propose to his girl, Reagan shares the flight with a schoolteacher, Ann McKnight (Peggy Dow), someone he met at a Reno casino and helped win at the gambling table. At the airport, he is met by the police; it seems they have been tipped off that Reagan is looking to stir trouble with Big Jim.
The police put a tail on him, which he shakes on a Chicago elevated train. Reagan meets up with his bride-to-be, Sally Lee (Dorothy Hart). He tells her he will go to Big Jim to make peace. But when the uncle is murdered, Reagan is framed for it.
On the run from both the police and from the unknown murderers, Reagan enlists the help of McKnight and an old buddy, Charles Reckling (Bruce Bennett), a detective. They discover the truth: Morgan is also engaged to Sally Lee, and together they are responsible for murdering her uncle and framing Reagan.
Reagan manages to clear himself, however, after which he and McKnight end up in each other's arms, bound for that lodge in Reno.

*'Raymond A. Litke' (1920-1986) was an American electronic engineer, the inventor of a practical wireless microphone, and the first to patent the wireless microphone. He was born and raised on a farm near Alma, Kansas, but spent most of his adult life in San Jose, California.
==Wireless microphone==
Litke invented a wireless microphone in 1957 while employed as an electronics expert at San Jose State College. His supervisor challenged him to invent a microphone to use in educational presentations which would be free of wires.
Litke’s wireless mike resembled a silver tube with “a microphone at the top, a transmitter in the middle and its battery power supply at the bottom.” It was 6 inches long, 1 inch in diameter, and weighed 7 ounces; the device had a broadcast range of up to a half-mile. Two types of mikes were available: lavalier and hand-held. A companion receiver, weighing 17 pounds, completed the portable sound system.
Although Litke prototyped the wireless microphone in 1957, he did not file for a patent until May 8, 1961. U.S. Patent No. 3,134,074 was officially granted on May 19, 1964. His microphone is sometimes also called the “Vega-Mike” after the Vega Electronics Corporation which first manufactured it as a product. Vega sold other electronics items and tapes developed by Litke.
Litke's wireless microphone was first tested at the Olympic trials held at Stanford University in 1959. Next, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC television) tested the microphone at the Democratic and Republican Conventions in 1960. Candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were among the first celebrities to use the Vega-Mike. TV anchor John Daly praised Litke's invention on the ABC television news broadcast in July 1960. Daly introduced it to Americans with the words: "This is a Vega-Mike" and went on to explain it "is a wireless microphone, six inches long... without any wires of any kind...." Daly pointed out it could be used to broadcast "within the (convention) hall or outside... without the inconvenience of interconnecting microphone cables...." Even the Federal Communication Commission was impressed with it. The FCC gave him 12 frequencies instead of the one he was seeking.
==Other accomplishments==
In the 1960s Litke worked at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center as the chief engineer of Educational Television and as an electronics expert. By 1961 he had worked for the University of California system for ten years.
==References==The 'Āinapō Trail' was the primary route to the summit of Mauna Loa from prehistory to 1916. The trail began on the southeast flank at 2000 feet of elevation and reached Mokuaweoweo, the summit crater, at .  It was sometimes called 'Menzies Trail' after Archibald Menzies who was the first recorded outsider to climb the mountain in 1794.
The Ainapo Trail was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 30, 1974.
==Early history==
This 35-mile (55 km) route from the small community of Kapapala (near present-day Pahala) had been used in Ancient Hawaii to make offerings to Pele during eruptions. The name comes from 'āina pō' in the Hawaiian language which means "darkened land", due to heavy clouds at the mid-elevation sections. At higher elevations above the clouds, the landscape is dry and barren lava rock. The climb is from about  at Kapapala to above  at the summit of Mokuaweoweo.
The trail was furnished with camps which provided rest areas and an opportunity to acclimate to the increasing altitude.  The camps consisted of temporary huts, or rock shelters, one of which was in a lava tube. In areas where the trail was hard to discern, rock cairns marked the way, placed to be visible along the skyline as travelers moved upwards.
In 1794, Archibald Menzies, a naturalist on the Vancouver Expedition, used the trail and about 100 Hawaiian porters to reach the summit and measure its elevation with a barometer.
Lieutenant Charles Wilkes of the 1840 United States Exploring Expedition first attempted to use a shorter route, but resorted to the Ainapo trail after making much slower progress than he planned in his trip to the summit.
The trail was widened in 1870 and again in 1913 when horses and mules started bringing more visitors to the summit.
==Decline and revival==
In 1915 the United States Army built a new trail directly from Kilauea Crater to Mokuaweoweo which was maintained by the National Park Service when the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was formed in 1916. The historic route fell into disuse since the lower elevations covered private land used for ranching and farming.
Today, only the section of about  above  remains in its original condition. 
The  on either side of the trail in this area was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 30, 1974, as site 74000290 and is state historic site 10-52-5501.
In the late 1990s a modern shelter was built at a historic camp site at an elevation of .
The lower area of Kapapala is now a private ranch, although hunting and camping can be arranged. Modern trails can now be taken from a trailhead on Ainapo road north of Hawaii Belt Road at coordinates , through the Kapapala State Forest Reserve, to the historic section of the Ainapo trail, all the way to the summit.

*'Keep'. Trim the plot summary, but otherwise this is a major character in a major series (which is getting replayed in prime time on another network than it originated on, which is almost unheard of).

No further edits should be made to this page.'Tropical Depression Two-E' was a short-lived tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico. It was the only cyclone during the month in the eastern North Pacific Ocean, forming on June 3 from a tropical wave. The depression initially moved northeastward, threatening the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero with a potential of it attaining tropical storm status. It remained a tropical depression, weakening due to land interaction and wind shear, and on June 5 it dissipated just off the coast. Rainfall from the depression peaked at 19.1 inches (486 mm) in Acapulco, which resulted in mudslides and flooding. A total of 42 houses were flooded, and 72 people were forced to leave their homes due to the storm; no deaths were reported.
==Meteorological history==
The tropical depression originated from a tropical wave off the southern coast of Mexico in late May 2006. An area of convection was associated with the wave, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that environmental conditions favored gradual development. The system, which was enhanced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), drifted northward with an anticyclone to its east and west. On June 1, the convection became more concentrated, and by early the next day it developed a low pressure area; by that time, it began a steady northwestward track.
An upper-level anticyclone north of the system provided a more favorable environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated for it to be considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June 3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500 UTC on June 3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140 mi (240 km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.
Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression was in an area not favorable for significant strengthening, due to land interaction and wind shear. It was tracking steadily northeastward, and as it moved closer to the coastline, the center of the depression was difficult to locate. However, the overall organization briefly improved, and in one forecast the depression was predicted to attain tropical storm status. Early on June 4, convection weakened significantly, leaving the center partially exposed. Continued wind shear brought most of the associated thunderstorm activity onshore southwestern Mexico while the center of the depression remained just offshore. Late on June 4, the circulation accelerated away from the deep convection as it passed a short distance south of Acapulco. Early on June 5, the circulation dissipated, and later that night the remnants moved inland.
==Preparations and impact==
Satellite image of the depression near southwestern Mexico
Due to uncertainty in whether the depression would attain tropical storm status or not, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Punta San Telmo, Michoacán to Acapulco, Guerrero. Prior to affecting the coastline, the Mexican meteorological agency issued a heavy rainfall advisory, also mentioning the potential for flooding and mudslides, for the states of Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Officials prepared 21 shelters in the region.
The depression produced heavy rainfall along the coastline, including a total of 19.1 inches (486 mm) measured in a 48‑hour period in Acapulco. Totals of over 2 inches (50 mm) spread across much of Guerrero and Oaxaca, causing flash flooding and mudslides. The storm partially flooded about 40 houses, and a total of 72 people were forced to leave their homes. In Acapulco, floodwaters washed trash from street corners onto the beaches. Elsewhere in Guerrero, the flooding and mudslides blocked several highways, which stranded dozens of vehicles. The wall of a prison collapsed due to the rainfall. Also in Acapulco, the rainfall downed trees and power lines, causing power outages and sparking a fire when a transformer exploded. No deaths were reported.

* Information about the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs by the State Department Historian
* Bureau of Consular Affairs Website'Hilde Mangold' (20 October 1898 – 4 September 1924) (née Proescholdt) was a German embryologist who was best known for her 1923 dissertation which was the foundation for her mentor, Hans Spemann's, 1935 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the embryonic organizer, "one of the very few doctoral theses in biology that have directly resulted in the awarding of a Nobel Prize". The general effect she demonstrated is known as embryonic induction, that is, the capacity of some cells to direct the developmental trajectory of other cells. Induction remains a fundamental concept and area of ongoing research in the field.
==Biography==
Hilde Proescholdt was born in Gotha, Thuringia, a province in central-eastern Germany on October 20, 1898. She was the middle daughter of soap factory owner Ernest Proescholdt and his wife Gertrude. She attended the University of Jena in Germany for two semesters in 1918 and 1919 and then transferred to the University of Frankfurt in Germany where she also spent two semesters. It was here that she saw a lecture by the renowned embryologist Hans Spemann on experimental embryology.
This lecture inspired her to pursue her education in this field. After Frankfurt, she attended the Zoological Institute in Freiburg. It was here that she met and married her husband, , who was Spemann’s chief assistant (and, incidentally, a supporter of the Nazi Party). Under Spemann's direction, she completed her 1923 dissertation, entitled “Über Induktion von Embryonalanlagen durch Implantation artfremder Organisatoren”, or “Induction of Embryonic Primordia by Implantation of Organizers from a Different Species.”
 
After earning her PhD in zoology, Hilde moved with her husband and infant son, Christian, to Berlin. Shortly after the move, Hilde died from severe burns as a result of a gas heater explosion in her Berlin home. She never lived to see the publication of her thesis results. Her son died in World War II.
==Key experiments==
Mangold performed very delicate transplantation experiments with embryos (a feat even more impressive before the discovery of antibiotics to prevent infection after surgery). She demonstrated that tissue from the dorsal lip of the blastopore grafted into a host embryo can induce the formation of an extra body axis, creating conjoined twins. Crucially, by using two  species of newt with different skin colors for host and donor, she showed that the amphibian organizer did not form the extra axis by itself, but recruited host tissue to form the twin (although the full implications of this result were not understood until a year after her death). This was the basis of the discovery of the "organizer", which is responsible for gastrulation.

It was shot in 4K on the RED ONE digital cinema camera in Colorado, USA.
==Plot==
In the mystical realm of Ryntia, the forces of the underworld are aligning to unleash a plague of evil upon the surface. The deadly bat-like Blood Reavers, the Goblin Hordes, the Saurian Maurauders, the Orcish Warmongers and the feline Shadowcat mercenaries have pledged their respective clans to the service of Bre'Gwen, queen of the deep elves. Together they seek to destroy the human and Elven kingdoms and rule all of Ryntia in the name of evil.
However even with their combined strength, Bre'Gwen's forces are no match for the powerful Grayraven kingdom led by the majestic king, Garrick Grayraven. To ensure their success, Bre'gwen forges an alliance with an unlikely human who holds the secret to acquiring a powerful artifact that will allow them to summon and control an army of undead warriors from centuries past. Guided by fragmented visions, a mysterious Oracle gathers seven unlikely heroes to face the threat. A heroic knight, a deep elf sorceress, an eccentric bard, a silver elf druid, a righteous paladin, a barbarian huntress, and a brooding thief are the only ones capable of stopping this evil at its source but first they must embark upon a quest to find the legendary seven swords of Draconus.

Article fails WP:MUSIC as it is a album that did not chart. Prod declined with the reasoning that the artist's article is too long to contain this information. —BradV 05:38, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

*'Keep' Nominator's rationale is mistaken- WP:MUSIC does not state that an album needs to have charted to be notable. Rather, it states that albums by notable musicians 'may' be notable. The musician in this case, Cosima De Vito, is notable. Considering one of the singles on this album charted, the album has been out for over 1 year, and the artist has other charting albums, I think we can safely assume this album is notable. —/Mendaliv/2¢/Δ's/ 06:40, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

* Bureau of Intelligence and Research WebsiteContent disputes which are complex in nature do not easily lend themselves to most available avenues of dispute resolution. This is particularly true of disputes which surround sources and how they are used in an article. If involved editors cannot by discussion resolve such issues, then anyone offering a third opinion, responding to a Request for Comment, or mediating would need to be somewhat familiar not only with the article but also with the sources in order to make any real progress. It may therefore be helpful to request a thorough review of the disputed content by an outside party. Such a review can include examination of the relevant sources. The disputed content may encompass most of an article, and several editors may be involved; this process is geared toward 'complex' disputes.
Follow these instructions to make your request for review below:
# Begin a new entry with a '#' symbol 'below earlier entries' to preserve the numbering and chronological order of the list.
# Provide a 'section link' to the most applicable talk page section, followed by a concise description of the dispute. This description should be as neutral as possible.

==Reviewing disputed content==
Only review disputed content in articles which you have not previously been involved with substantially.The 'Otoe Reservation' was a twenty-four square-mile section straddling the Kansas-Nebraska state line. The majority of the reservation sat in modern-day southeast Jefferson County, Nebraska. 
As early as 1834, the Oto relinquished land to the government in fulfillment of a treaty. It extended two miles (3 km) south of the state line its full length, into Washington and Marshall counties, Kansas. In Nebraska it extended  into Jefferson County, which was earlier called Jones County, and Gage County. Altogether it comprised 250 sections totaling . The Glenwood, Paddock, Liberty Township and Barneston Townships are wholly within the historic boundaries of the reservation. It also included sections of the Elm, Sicily, Wymore, and Island Grove Townships.
Although the Oto were originally located throughout southeastern Nebraska, their main town was once located along the Platte River near present-day Plattsmouth in the eastern part of the state.  The Moses Merrill Mission was located in this area. When the Nebraska Territory was formed in 1854, the Oto resigned their remaining land claim with the exception of a section near the Big Blue River. This became the Otoe Reservation. 
In 1879, a new treaty with the federal government gave it the legal control to allow the Otoe to sell the reservation for tribal annuities, and relocate to "Indian country"Oklahoma. In the fall of 1882, the rest of the tribe moved to Red Rock, Oklahoma, the reservation was disbanded, and the "undeveloped" land was put for sale. The few remaining Otoes were of mixed background and quickly integrated with the new settlers, most notably the Barnes's of French and Otoe background.  
On May 31, 1883,  of the Oto and Missouri Indian Reservation in Kansas and Nebraska were opened for settlement at a public sale. When the Oto were removed, the southeast corner of Jefferson County was opened to settlement and the community of Diller was formed. 
In 1886 the tribe shared an agent with several other local tribes, including the Ponca and Pawnee. The agency was located on the Oto Reservation.  The present-day town of Barneston was settled at the site of one of the largest Oto villages through the 19th century. The Indian agency and a trading post were located there. Barneston was founded by a French fur trapper who married to an Oto woman.

== Notes =='Leighton Hall' is a historic house  to the west of Yealand Conyers, Lancashire, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.
==History==
It was the seat of the 1642–1673 Middleton Baronetcy of Sir George Middleton, who was High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1661. He was succeeded by his grandson, George Middleton Oldfield, who died at the hall in 1708. It then passed to his son-in-law Albert Hodgson, who had married Oldfield's daughter Dorothy. Hodgson became involved in the Jacobite rising of 1715, during which he was taken prisoner, and the house burnt with Hodgson's possessions confiscated. When the hall was sold at public auction in 1722 it was bought by a friend, a Mr Winkley from Preston, who allowed Hodgson to live in the partly ruined house after his eventual release from prison. The estate then came into the possession of wealthy George Towneley of Towneley Hall in Burnley, through his marriage to Hodgson's daughter Mary in the 1750s.
The present house was built for Towneley in 1759–61 in Georgian style to a design by John Hird, and the woods replanted and park laid out in 1763. The couple had no children, and the estate was inherited by George's nephew John, who sold it 1805. In 1822 the property came into the possession of Richard Gillow, the grandson of furniture manufacturer Robert Gillow, who Gothicized the façade in 1822–25 using local white limestone.  In 1870 his son, Richard Thomas Gillow, commissioned the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin to add a three-storey wing containing a billiard room below, and guest rooms above. Richard died in 1906, leaving the hall in a neglected condition and was succeeded by his grandson, Charles Richard Gillow, who died in 1923. Charles' widow continued to live at the hall until her own death in 1966 at the age of 96. The property then passed via her daughter Helen to her grandson, Richard Gillow Reynolds who, with his wife Susan, is the current owner.
The hall was featured in the 1984 ITV TV adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes story 'The Adventure of the Dancing Men', as Ridling Thorp Manor.

==Obama and Trump administrations==
Harold W. Geisel served as acting inspector general during Hillary Clinton's service as Secretary of State., which lasted until February 1, 2013. There was no permanent inspector general at the State Department while Clinton was Secretary, nor did President Barack Obama nominate anyone for that position. Later in 2013, Obama nominated Steve A. Linick, and the Senate confirmed Linick to the role. 
Linick served as inspector general for the balance of Obama's term, continuing into the presidency of Donald Trump. On Friday, May 15, 2020 at 10 p.m., the White House announced that Linick had been removed. The White House said Trump had dismissed Linick at the request of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Linick had been conducting several investigations into actions by Pompeo. Trump appointed Stephen Akard, who was concurrently serving as the director of the State Department's Office of Foreign Missions, as acting inspector general. Akard served as acting inspector general less than three months before resigning. Deputy Inspector General Diana Shaw then became acting inspector general.

No further edits should be made to this page.'William Thomas 'Poley'  Evans' (9 April 1876 – 19 July 1964) was an Australian sportsman. He captained Queensland at first-class cricket and represented Australia in rugby union. He was born in Indooroopilly, Queensland and died at Buranda, Queensland.
==Rugby union career==
Evans, who played on the wing, won two caps for Australia at rugby in 1899 as a winger in the national side. His debut game was against Matthew Mullineux's first British Lions to tour Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 24 June 1899, the inaugural rugby Test match played by an Australian national representative side. He scored a try in that match and is listed on rugby records by the name 'Poley' Evans.  Four weeks later he played in the second Test in Brisbane. His performance in that match was noted as 'excellent' by the press. He made a state appearance for Queensland that year against those same tourists. Poley's younger brother Lew Evans also represented for Australia from 1903 to 1904.
==Cricket career==
Evans, who often batted with the tail, made just one first-class century. It came against New South Wales at the Brisbane Cricket Ground in 1908, when he came in at number nine in the batting order and scored 103 not out.
 When he returned to cricket in 1902 it was as a wicket-keeper and he kept wicket for all but one of his first-class matches from that point.
Queensland didn't play in the Sheffield Shield during Evans's career so most of his appearances were in Brisbane, when they took on touring states. He regularly captained Queensland and even had the honour of captaining an Australian XI for a first-class match against South Africa in 1910.
When Evans made his first-class debut in 1899, it was as an all-rounder. Bowling right arm overarm, he took 7/70, despite his opponents the South Australians amassing 582 runs. It was the first ever time the two states had met at first-class level and thus Evans has the distinction of being the first Queenslander to take a five wicket haul against South Australia.

*The 'Planctus '('de obitu')' Karoli' ("Lament on the Death of Charlemagne"), also known by its incipit 'A solis ortu' ('usque ad occidua') ("From the rising of the sun to the setting"), is an anonymous medieval Latin 'planctus' eulogising Charlemagne, written in accented verse by a monk of Bobbio shortly after his subject's death in 814. It is generally considered the earliest surviving 'planctus', though its melody is written in tenth-century neumes, one of the earliest surviving examples of this sort of musical notation. The poem has been translated into English by Peter Godman. 
The authorship of the 'Planctus' has been a matter of some dispute. Its author has been identified with Columbanus of Saint Trond, who, it is claimed, also wrote the 'Ad Fidolium', a set of quantitative adonics. The 'Planctus' appeared in a seventeenth-century manuscript compilation of the poems of Hrabanus Maurus under the subscription "Hymnus Columbani ad Andream episcopum de obitu Caroli", which inspired L. A. Muratori to make the identification, but this late ascription to a Columbanus is probably deduced from the poem's own seventeenth stanza. As argued by Heinz Löwe, that stanza in fact makes it very difficult to argue that the poet, who consistently uses the first person, was the Columbanus he refers to.
The poem is composed of twenty three-line romance strophes each with a distich of two dodecasyllables and the parenthetical heptasyllabic refrain 'Heu mihi misero!', which does not mark a division in thought but is inserted regularly in an otherwise continuous syntax. Each dodecasyllable ends in a paroxytone ('mot métrique'). The existence of quilisma in the musical notation indicates the influence of plainchant. 
The first line ('A solis ortu...') is drawn from a fifth-century hymn of Caelius Sedulius. As the Sedulian hymn was sung at Christmastime, the sorrowful 'Planctus' presents a contrast with the joy typically associated with its opening. The poet expands upon his personal grief at the death of his emperor—and benefactor of Bobbio—by asking all the regions of Earth to mourn with him, and using the tears of Saint Columbanus, founder of Bobbio, as a symbol of the monastery's grief. The rhythm of the verse, presence of musical notation, and orientation towards contemporary events suggest popular recitation or performance. The poem, though associated with the Carolingian Renaissance in Latin letters, is not a commentary on the "disintegration" (or 'décomposition') of the Carolingian Empire after the death of Charlemagne.

==References=='New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future' is a feminist utopian novel, written by Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett and first published in 1889. It was one element in the wave of utopian and dystopian literature that marked the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
==Context==
Corbett wrote the novel in response to Mrs Humphry Ward's "An Appeal Against Female Suffrage", an open letter published in 'The Nineteenth Century' and signed by over a hundred other women against the extension of Parliamentary suffrage to women.
==Plot==
In her novel, Corbett envisions a successful suffragette movement eventually giving rise to a breed of highly evolved "Amazonians" who turn Ireland into a utopian society. The book's female narrator wakes up in the year 2472, much like Julian West awakens in the year 2000 in Edward Bellamy's 'Looking Backward' (1888). Corbett's heroine, however, is accompanied by a man of her own time, who has similarly awakened from a hashish dream to find himself in New Amazonia.
The Victorian woman and man are given an account of intervening history by one of the Amazonians. In the early twentieth century, war between Britain and Ireland decimated the Irish population; the British repopulated the island with their own surplus women. (After the war, which also involved France on the side of Ireland, British women outnumbered men by three to one.) Women came to dominate all aspects of society on the island.
The history lesson is followed by a tour of the new society, which embodies a version of state socialism. Men are allowed to live on the island, but cannot hold political office: "masculine government has always held openings for the free admission of corruption, injustice, immorality, and narrow-minded, self-glorifying bigotry." The Amazonians are vegetarians; they employ euthanasia, eliminating malformed children — and bastards. They maintain their superiority by practicing "nerve-rejuvenation," in which the life energy of dogs is transferred to humans. The result is that the Amazonians grow to be seven feet tall, and live for hundreds of years but look no older than forty. The narrator tries the procedure herself: "The sensation I experienced was little more than a pin-prick in intensity, but...I felt ten years younger and stronger, and was proportionately elated at my good fortune." (The procedure, though, is fatal to the dogs.)
The narrator reacts very positively to what she sees and learns; but her male companion reacts precisely oppositely and adjusts badly — to the point where the Amazonians judge him to be insane. The narrator nonetheless tries to protect her male counterpart, and in the process is accidentally transported back to the grimmer realities of Victorian England.
==Matriarchy resistance==
W. H. Hudson's second novel, 'A Crystal Age' (1887), published two years earlier than Corbett's book, also contains the plot element of a nineteenth-century man who cannot adapt to a matriarchal society of the future.
==The author==
Little is known about Newcastle journalist Elizabeth Corbett, who published as "Mrs. George Corbett." Some of her fifteen novels — mysteries, adventure stories, and mainstream fiction — have clear feminist themes and elements, despite the traditional values of the age in which she lived and worked.

==References=='Franz Schubert' (original German title: 'Franz Schubert – Ein Leben in zwei Sätzen') is a 1953 Austrian film depicting composer Franz Schubert's life and work.
It was shot at the Rosenhügel Studios in Vienna with sets designed by the art director Leo Metzenbauer.
== Plot ==
Franz Schubert works as an assistant teacher in the school led by his father.  In his spare time, however, the young man, who considers Ludwig van Beethoven to be his unattainable role model, devotes himself to writing music. As public acceptance is denied to him, his friends lobby at the music publisher Anton Diabelli for a public performance of Schubert's music. During a reception, at which Schubert performs his 'Ave Maria', he gets to know singer Therese Grob.
Schubert decides to quit the employment at his father's and, instead, to concentrate merely on music, and moves in his with friends, poets Franz von Schober and Moritz von Schwind and painter Johann Mayerhofer. There, he is inspired to set Johann Wolfgang von Goethes ballad 'Der Erlkönig' to music.
Schubert friends encourage him to play his music in public. Schubert and Therese, who sings his songs, are made one. The two make a living with performing Schuberts songs. Schubert, though, develops doubts, whether he can express himself in songs appropriately, and so decides to turn to writing symphonies and operas. As Schubert applies for the position of a Vice Director of Music, Therese hands over to the Secretary of the Court Theatre Schuberts latest work, the 'Unfinished Symphony'. Disagreements arise during the rehearsals for Schubert's latest opera, as the singer of the leading part considers the music too difficult to sing. Music publishers Tobias Haslinger and Anton Diabelli reject his music. Even his very promising application as a Vice Director of Music proves to be unsuccessful.
Thus, depressed Schubert decides to tour his songs in order to make a living. In this period of time, he writes the 'Winterreise'.
After having returned, Schubert decides to have lessons in counterpoint with Beethoven, but shies away from contacting his idol. Shortly later, while being plagued by health problems, Schubert gets a visit from Beethoven's secretary Anton Schindler. Sickly Beethoven sends some Goethe poems to Schubert to be set in music, as Beethoven regards Schubert to be the better song composer.
As Schubert wants to visit Beethoven, he arrives too late: Beethoven has died. Schubert is one of the torchbearers during Beethoven's funeral. Suffering from more and more serious health problems, Schubert is no longer able to perceive the success of a public performance of his music. He dies one year after his idol.

The law replaced the 'Tobacco Act', Bill C-71 during the 35th Canadian Parliament in 1997, which itself replaced the former 'Tobacco Sales To Young Persons Act' of 1994 as well as the 'Tobacco Products Control Act' of 1989. The 'Tobacco Act' was amended on July 5, 2010 and renamed to 'Tobacco and Vaping Products Act' in 2018 when similar laws concerning vaping products were added.
== Purpose ==
The purpose of the Act is to protect the health of Canadians by imposing limits on the sale and production of tobacco products. It increases awareness of the health risks associated with use of tobacco products. The Act also protects young people by restricting the age of purchase.
== Regulations made under the Act ==
=== Tobacco (Access) Regulations ===
The legal age to purchase tobacco products varies with each province. A person may be asked for documentation to verify their age before purchasing a tobacco product. Under the Act, suitable forms of identification include a driver's license, passport, Canadian permanent resident document, certificate of Canadian citizenship with signature, or a Canadian Armed Forces identification card. Forms of identification issued by a provincial, federal, or foreign government with a signature, photo, and date of birth are also accepted. In addition, every retailer must place a sign near the tobacco products. The sign must adhere to the specifications outlined in the 'Tobacco Act'. It must be in a visible location with a surface area no smaller than 600 cm2 with the following text:
:"It is prohibited by federal law to provide tobacco products to persons under 18 years of age. Il est interdit par la loi fédérale de fournir des produits du tabac aux personnes âgées de moins de 18 ans.”
=== Tobacco products labelling regulations (cigarettes and little cigars) ===
Tobacco products must have legible packaging with text in both of Canada's official languages, English and French. The package must contain health warnings and information on toxic emissions, either in the form of text or pictures and text. They must be displayed on equal opposite sides of the packaging, on the largest visible side, and on the lid. The warnings may also be included on a leaflet that is visible when accessing the product.
=== Promotion of tobacco products and accessories regulations (prohibited perms) ===
The Act prohibits the promotion and advertising of tobacco products when the terms "light" or "mild" are used. This applies to products, packaging, and accessories associated with tobacco. A retailer also cannot display these products if "light" and "mild" are on the packaging.
=== Cigarette ignition propensity regulations ===
The Act requires that every brand of cigarettes manufactured on or after October 1, 2005, be tested by manufacturers to make sure the cigarette burns up completely less than 25% of the time. The test is to be conducted using 10 layers of filter paper and each cigarette tested must be of the same brand.
== References =='Barry Fey' (1938 – April 28, 2013) was an American rock concert promoter from Colorado who was best known for bringing prominent music acts to the United States for the first time.
== Career ==
Fey's first concert was Baby Huey and the Babysitters in 1965 at the American Legion Hall in Rockford that made only $92.  On December 26, 1968 Fey promoted the first Led Zeppelin show in the United States.  In June 1969, Feyline presented the 3 day Denver Pop Festival, which featured the final performance of The Jimi Hendrix Experience.
In 1976 Fey's company Feyline started his 'Summer of Stars' concert series at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. For three consecutive years (1978, 1979, 1980) Fey was voted promoter of the year by 'Billboard'  magazine.
In 1983 Fey, Chris Blackwell, and U2 produced the 'U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky' concert film.
In 1997, Fey was voted into the Touring Hall of Fame by 'Performance' magazine.
In 1998, Fey was the majority owner of Breeder's Cup Sprint champion Reraise.
Besides concerts Fey has been credited with saving the bankrupt Denver Symphony, and forming the Colorado Symphony Orchestra. He put them on a pay as you go basis, which allowed the symphony to thrive. When the historic Paramount Theater in downtown Denver was facing destruction, Fey stepped in, and signed a ten-year contract, saving the building.
In 1983, he opened the doors for Major League Baseball in Denver by teaming up with Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, and putting on an old timers baseball game.
In 1991, Fey merged with Universal Concerts, which later bought him out in 1997, after a 30-year career. In an interview with 'Image' magazine they called Fey, "Not only the best promoter in the land, but "A National Treasure."
President Bill Clinton videotaped a message of thanks and congratulations upon Fey's retirement in 1997.
In 2009 Fey got his own radio show called "Behind the Scenes with Barry Fey" on Mile High Sports Radio, 1510 AM that discussed the music business and sports with callers.
On January 1, 2010 his official website  titled the "Rockfather" was launched where he announced that he would be teaching a class  "Real History of Rock -n- Roll" at the University of Colorado beginning in February and doing speaking engagements worldwide.  He also announced that he was in negotiations to write a tell all book about the music business.
On November 1, 2011 Fey announced the completion of his book "'Backstage Past"' with forewords written by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne and Pete Townshend.
== Death ==
In spring of 2013, Fey had hip-replacement surgery and struggled afterwards. Unusually dour in the weeks before his death, of the surgery ordeal, Fey said, "They tell you it's a major surgery, but they don't tell you how hard it's going to be." With his son Geoffry taking care of him after the surgery, Fey had arranged for his other sons to also be near him. Fey committed suicide on Sunday, April 28, 2013, quite literally between a breakfast omelet order with son Geoffry and its delivery.
The Barry Fey Foundation was formed "to eradicate suicide in our Colorado entertainment community." The planned 30th anniversary Red Rocks showing of U2's "Under a Blood Red Sky", a foundation fundraiser in conjunction with the Denver Film Society, was cancelled so as not to compete with fundraising efforts for the devastating mid-September Colorado floods. They plan to show the film in 2014 as part of the popular Film on the Rocks series.
Years ago, Fey had made a deal with a former mayor of Morrison, home of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, to be buried at the residents-only cemetery just below his beloved Red Rocks, but the paperwork was lost and the request denied. The back-up plan was to scatter Fey's ashes at Red Rocks.

The 28 April 1951 election was a double dissolution called by Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies in an attempt to gain control of the Senate and to pass a bill to ban the Communist Party of Australia, if necessary at a joint sitting of both houses.  All 121 seats in the House of Representatives, and all 60 seats in the Senate were up for election. The incumbent Liberal Party of Australia led by Menzies with coalition partner the Country Party led by Arthur Fadden defeated the Australian Labor Party led by Ben Chifley and gained control of the Senate with 32 seats to Labor's 28.
In accordance with section 13 of the Constitution, terms for Senators was taken to commence on 1 July 1950.  The first five Senators elected in each State were allocated the full six-year terms ending on 30 June 1956 while the other half were allocated three-year terms ending on 30 June 1953.

*The five 'Tarokoid languages' are a branch of the Plateau family spoken in central Nigeria, just north of the middle reaches of the Benue River. Tarok itself has 300,000 speakers, with Pe and Sur about 5,000 each. Yangkam is severely endangered, being spoken by around fifty elderly men.
The Tarokoid languages have significantly influenced the Ron languages and later Ngas, but not the other West Chadic languages of Tel, Goemai, Mupun, and Mwaghavul. Most borrowed words went from Tarok to Chadic, although occasionally Chadic words were also borrowed into Tarok. Today, Tarok remains the lingua franca of the southern Plateau region of Nigeria.
==Classification==
The only language with significant data is Tarok. Pe (Pai) has been placed in various branches of Plateau, and Kwang (Kwanka) was only recently added, but it now seems clear that the following five languages belong together. The classification below follows Blench (2004).

*The 'Oregon Beach Bill' (House Bill 1601, 1967) was a piece of landmark legislation in the U.S. state of Oregon, passed by the 1967 session of the Oregon Legislature. It established public ownership of land along the Oregon Coast from the water up to sixteen vertical feet above the low tide mark.
== Background ==
After Oregon achieved statehood in 1859, the completion of railroads through the Coast Range mountains encouraged land development along the ocean shore. In 1874, the Oregon State Land Board began selling public tidelands to private landowners. Resorts grew up around the beaches at Seaside, Newport, and Rockaway, and the newly completed railroads brought tourists from the population centers of the Willamette Valley for weekend vacations. By 1901, about  of tideland had been sold.
In 1911, governor Oswald West was elected on the promise to reclaim Oregon's beaches as public land. The legislature favored the privatization of these lands, but West was able to make an argument for public ownership based on the need for transportation. The 1913 legislature declared the entire length of the ocean shore from Washington to California as a state highway. Legislators also created the State Highway Commission, which began the construction of Highway 101. The Parks and Recreation Department, a branch of the highway commission, bought land for 36 state parks along the coastal highway, an average of one every . With the completion of the highway and parks system, coastal tourism skyrocketed.
== History ==
Oregon's public lands claim was challenged in 1966, when Cannon Beach motel owner William Hay fenced some dry sands above the high tide line and reserved it for private use. After citizens complained to the state government, state legislators put forward the Oregon Beach Bill, modeled on the Texas Open Beaches Act. Conservative Republicans and coastal developers called the bill a threat to private property rights, and it nearly died in the legislature. In response, Republican Governor Tom McCall staged a dramatic media event on May 13, 1967, flying two helicopters to the beach with a team of surveyors and scientists. The ensuing media coverage resulted in overwhelming public demand for the bill. The bill was passed by the legislature in June and signed by McCall on July 6, 1967.
The Beach Bill declares that all "wet sand" within sixteen vertical feet of the low tide line belongs to the state of Oregon. In addition, it recognizes public easements of all beach areas up to the line of vegetation, regardless of underlying property rights. The public has "free and uninterrupted use of the beaches," and property owners are required to seek state permits for building and other uses of the ocean shore. While some parts of the beach remain privately owned, state and federal courts have upheld Oregon’s right to regulate development of those lands and preserve public access.
In 2013, OPB released an episode of their "The Oregon Experience" television docu-series on the bill, which features the legislators involved in creating the bill, journalists who covered its development in 1967, and archival footage of Oregon beach history. 
In 2017, Oregon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Beach Bill's passing.

==Classification==
There is little data on the Ninzic languages, and it is not clear that all of the following languages are related. Blench (2008) lists the following languages, twice as many as Greenberg 1963 ("Plateau IV"). They are not subclassified apart from a few obvious dialect clusters.
:Ce (Che, Rukuba), Ninzo (Ninzam), Mada, Ninkyop (Kaninkwom)–Nindem, Kanufi (Anib), Gwantu (Gbantu), Bu-Ninkada (Bu), Ningye, Nungu, Ninka, Gbətsu, Nkɔ
and perhaps Ayu.

== History ==
The Green Party of Florida was organized in 1992. At that time the State of Florida had a very stringent standard applied to what were considered minor party candidates in elections. To have statewide ballot status, minor parties had to file a petition with at least 3% of all registered voters. To keep this status, they had to maintain a number of party members equal to 5% of all registered voters.
In 1998 state law concerning access to the state ballot was eased. In February 1999 the state legislature implemented changes allowing any party organized on a state basis to field candidates in elections. This allowed the Green Party and other parties to qualify to field candidates on the ballot. The Green Party has retained its statewide ballot status ever since.
The Florida Green Party has opposed the presence of nuclear power plants in Florida. In fact, the party intervened in the licensing process of the proposed Levy County Nuclear Power Plant, which has yet to be built.
In April 2010 the Florida Green Party and the People's Lobby Coalition for Public Funding Only of All Elections held a public forum at the National Press Club in Washington, DC. The purpose of the forum was to press for only public funding of elections.

These include the Electoral Committee, the Bylaws Committee, the Fund-Raising Committee, the Media Committee, the Outreach Committee and the IT (information technology) Committee. The Electoral Committee helps persons wanting to become candidates and also asks potential candidates about their political views.
The Green Party has ten chapters, which usually are county chapters. The state organization constantly seeks to organize new local chapters.
The Florida Green Party is listed as an endorser organization of the Move to Amend. This organization, in its own words, is "dedicated to ending the illegitimate legal doctrines that prevent the American people from governing themselves."

*'Agaricus pattersoniae' is an edible species of mushroom. It is found in the United States, where it associates with cypress trees. It has been proposed for inclusion in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
==Taxonomy==
It was first described in the literature in 1907 by Charles Horton Peck, based on specimens found by , a botany student at Stanford University. She found fruit bodies on Stanford campus in January, where they were growing under pine and cypress trees. The specific epithet was originally spelled "Pattersonae" by Peck, although this is now considered an orthographic variant. This species is placed in section 'Sanguinolenti' of genus 'Agaricus'.
==Description==
The cap,  in diameter, is initially almost hemispherical in shape, transforming to broadly convex and finally to flattened or with edges upturned in age. The cap surface is dry, with fibrils when young, but later the fibrils form large, dark brown appressed squamules (2–9 mm long by 2–5 mm broad). The cap color may be various shades of brown depending on the maturity of the specimen. The cap flesh is typically  thick, firm, white, and stains deep red 20–30 seconds after injury or bruising. The odor immediately after cutting is mild, faintly spicy, but several minutes may be described as 'fruity'. An edible mushroom, the taste of 'A. pattersoniae' is described as mild, pleasant, and slightly sweet.
The gills are free in attachment, closely spaced,  broad, and marginate. The light-cinnamon color in young specimens turns to a dark blackish brown in age after the spores develop. Bruised gills stain a vinaceous (wine-colored) red.
The stipe is usually  long by  thick with a bulbous shape. The interior is hollow, with the internal cavity being between  thick. The stipe context somewhat fibrous and white in color, except for the basal section which is yellowish. Bruising or cutting results in a red stain after a minute. The surface of the stipe is barely striate above the annulus, and smooth below except for fragments of the universal veil. During development the veils rupture and form an upper veil (partial veil), which initially hangs from the edge of the cap, and a lower veil. As the partial veil disintegrates, it often leaves fragments 2–3 mm in size attached to the margin.
The spores are roughly elliptical in shape, 7–8.5 by 5.5–6.5 μm. The basidia, which may be 1–, 2–, 3–, or 4–spored (although usually 4–spored during active sporulation), are 26–34 by 7–11 μm,  cylinder- to club-shaped, with sterigmata that are 2–3 μm long. Cheilocystidia are 12–32 by 6–15 μm in size, almost cylindrical or club-shaped, and may appear clumped or continuous.
==Habitat and distribution==
'Agaricus pattersoniae' is associated with cypress ('Cupressus macrocarpa') trees, where it fruits singly or in groups. Richard Kerrigan noted that it seems to be restricted to mature trees (age 40+ years) located in the coastal counties of California, although Alexander H. Smith mentions that it has also been found in the Great Lakes regions. The species has been proposed for inclusion in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as part of the Global Fungal Red List initiative. Its main threats include habitat destruction, drought, and decline of cypress trees due to cypress canker from infection by 'Seiridium cardinale'. The cypress trees have been removed from the type locality.

==Biography==
Georges Tron received a Masters in Public Law. In 1986, he was appointed as parliamentary advisor to Édouard Balladur, then Minister of Economy and Finance. From 1988 to 1993, he served as Chief of Staff for Balladur. From 1997 to 2002, he served as budgetary advisor to the Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin.
In 1999, he served as National Secretary of the Rally for the Republic and in 2002, he joined the Union for a Popular Movement.

In May 2011, George Tron became the subject of a preliminary investigation into charges of sexual harassment after two women alleged that he had attacked them between 2007 and 2010, which led him to resign as a junior minister for the civil service, tendering his resignation to French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Tron linked the case to a feud with relatives of Presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who announced she would sue him for libel.
In February 2021, he was sentenced on appeal to 5 years of imprisonment for the sexual harassment and rape of his former employee.

Gilles Bourdouleix was elected mayor of Cholet the first time on 19 June 1995 with a lead of 148 votes. He succeeded Maurice Ligot who was his chief of staff. He was elected mayor again in the second round of voting in March 2001 with 61.69% of the votes. He was again reelected in 2008.
In 2002, Bourdouleix was elected a member of the National Assembly of France as a member of the UMP. He has continued to serve in the office since then, though switching parties to Union of Democrats and Independents for his third election in 2012 and then leaving parties all together in August 2013.  Bourdouleix represents the department of Maine-et-Loire.
== Controversy ==
In July 2013, French blogger Benjamin Charles-Lemaire revealed that Bourdouleix said Adolf Hitler had not killed enough Romani people. Bourdouleix, who had been faced with Nazi salutes and accusations of racism, is said to have stated about a group of Romani people in exasperation, "It's almost as if Hitler didn't kill enough of them." On 22 July these remarks were reported in the French newspaper 'Le Courrier de l'Ouest' which led to a significant political outcry against Bourdouleix. Bourdouleix went on to defend himself saying, "You all call me Hitler, and you think that's okay, no?" He then went on to clarify, "I said that if I were Hitler, these people here would be killed. There, that's basically what I said."
After Bourdouleix refuted comments published by Lemaire, 'Le Courrier de l'Ouest' published audio recording in order to verify their claims, and a forensic analysis of the recording certified it as authentic. This, along with the initial accusations, led to an investigation of Bourdouleix by the Criminal Court of Angers which charged him with condoning crimes against humanity and defamation of the newspaper 'Le Courrier de l'Ouest. 'On 23 January 2014 Bourdouleix was found guilty of the charge and was fined 3,000 euros, though his fine was suspended. On 12 August 2014 Bourdouleix's conviction was upheld by the  Court of Appeal. On 15 December 2015 the Court of Appeal cancelled the sentence.

*  Le blog d'information de Guillaume Garot'Livermore V. Waite' is an 1894 California Supreme Court ruling that limits the power of the legislature in making amendments to the California Constitution by ruling that the power to change to the constitution cannot be delegated to any individual, as the sovereign power rests with the people 
The decision was met with the full concurrence of the court, with the majority opinion authored by Justice Harrison and the concurring opinion authored by Justice Paterson.
== Background ==
In the session of congress prior to this case, congress approved by a two-thirds majority in each house, an amendment to the constitution changing section 1 of article XX of the constitution to change the capital of California from Sacramento to San Jose pending a two-thirds approval by the electorate, a donation of ten acres in San Jose to the state, and one million dollars for the move. It also authorized the Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General to approve the site and upon approval and transferring the one million dollars into the state treasury, the legislature would provide for the erection of the building, and the removal of the capital at Sacramento.
As a taxpayer and citizen, Horatio Livermore brought action against the secretary of state to restrain from publishing in the statutes, and sending to the county clerks of the state, the proposed senate constitutional amendment because he felt that congress had out stepped its authority in making this amendment, and that it would be inoperative if approved by the people. This would result in an improper expenditure of public money. 
The lower court ruled in the plaintiff Livermore's favor, to which the defendant Waite appealed and the Supreme Court affirmed the decision, finding the amendment to be unconstitutional.
== Opinion ==
The constitution can be changed in two methods, a revision to the constitution by delegates in a convention with the purpose of revising the entire document, in which the limitations are set only by the United States Constitution.
The second is by adoption by the people of more limited amendments that have been passed two-thirds majority of the legislature.
The court provided a definition under Article XVIII of an amendment and a revision:
The very term "constitution" implies an instrument of a permanent and abiding nature, and the provisions contained therein for its revision indicate the will of the people that the underlying principles upon which it rests, as well as the substantial entirety of the instrument, shall be of a like permanent and abiding nature. On the other hand, the significance of the term "amendment" implies such an addition or change within the lines of the original instrument as will effect an improvement, or better carry out the purpose for which it was framed.
The court decided that by making the amendment conditional pending the approval was of the new location of the capital by the Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General, their votes superseded the vote of the people, and that in effect, the vote of the people would was simply a manner in which to send it to a higher power for approval. This amendment would not become operational on popular approval, but on conditions not specified there. This meant that the proposition was not passed in accordance with either method in the Constitution for amendment or revision, therefore rendering it unconstitutional.
== Significance ==
In August 1999, the Alaska Supreme Court used the ruling in Livermore v. Waite in the case Bess v. Ulmer noting "it is helpful to look to the law of California, a state which has considered the issue carefully over a period of nearly one hundred years. A line of California Supreme Court cases, beginning with Livermore v. Waite, has outlined the parameters of the procedures for constitutional change in that state."
==Notes==The , or 'NITE' is an Independent Administrative Institution, established by Japanese government, aiming to contribute to the "safety and security of life" supported by reliable technology and information.
== History ==
The predecessors of NITE were five Inspection Institutes of the Japanese government, such as the Export Silk Fabrics Inspection Institute established in 1928, Machinery and Tools Inspection Institute in 1948. After several reorganization steps, they were integrated into the International Trade and Industry Inspection Institute in 1984. It was reorganized into the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation in 1995 and established as an incorporated administrative agency in 2001 remaining under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
== Missions ==
* To establish intellectual foundations for the development of the economy as well as for the safety and security of society.
NITE works toward the mission by technical evaluation of industrial products, and preservation and distribution of products’ information, in the following four fields.
1. Biotechnology field
The Department of Biotechnology (DOB) manages NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC), which works as a national culture collection in Japan. It is dedicated to the acquisition, characterization, identification, and preservation of microorganisms, such as bacteria, archaea, fungi and microalgae, and distribution of those microbes together with their genetic information to the universities, research institutions and industries. It also manages a patent depositary for biological material under the Budapest Treaty. Based on the principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), DOB has been conducting collaborative research with a number of Asian countries in conservation and sustainable use of microbial resources. It also works for biosafety following by the guidelines of Cartagena Protocol.
 
2. Chemical management field
The Chemical Management Center of NITE undertakes a central role in the comprehensive chemical management. The three main aspects of the center's activities are 1) Support for the enforcement of laws and regulations related to the risk management of chemical substances, 2) Arrangement and provision of comprehensive information, by developing databases, to provide knowledge required for implementing chemical management system, 3) Development and management of risk assessment of chemical substances.
3. Accreditation field
The International Accreditation Japan (IAJapan) is an accreditation body that was established following a comprehensive review of accreditation programs for testing and calibration laboratories operated at NITE. The establishment of IAJapan is based on the perception that it is the duty of the government accreditation body to respond to requests from industries, academies, and the government administrations. Accreditation programs currently operated in IAJapan include MLAP (Specified Measurement Laboratory Accreditation Program), JCSS (Japan Calibration Service System), JNLA (Japan National Laboratory Accreditation System) and ASNITE (Accreditation System of NITE).
4. Consumer products safety field
The Products Safety Technology Center of NITE collects accidents information on consumer products, investigates their causes and makes the results available to the public. It also conducts product tests to identify the safety and quality performances, and on-site inspections to confirm businesses’ compliance with the laws and regulations on product safety. The results are periodically stored in an accident information database, which is made available to the public on the website. The Center also contributes to the development of standards in the area related to the consumer safety, in collaboration with universities and research institutes.

A FC Barcelona youth product, he appeared in 279 Segunda División matches over 11 seasons, mainly with Gimnàstic (five years) and Barcelona B (three). He added in 134 and one goal in La Liga, where he represented the former club and also Sporting de Gijón, Rayo Vallecano, Betis and Albacete.
==Club career==
Born in Hostalric, Girona, Catalonia, Mingo began his football career in FC Barcelona's youth system. Playing alongside Albert Celades and Iván de la Peña, he won the 1994 'División de Honor' and the 'Copa del Rey Juvenil'; already a senior, he spent three seasons with the club's B-team.
Mingo was released in the summer of 1997, moving to Sporting de Gijón and making his La Liga debut that season as the Asturias side were finally relegated. After two seasons he returned to the top flight with Rayo Vallecano, where his good performances attracted attention from Real Betis, with a good first campaign being followed by two subpar ones (in his last year, however, he scored his first goal in the top level, a 2–1 away win against RCD Espanyol on 25 January 2004).
In 2004, Mingo moved to Albacete Balompié, playing one season each in the first and second divisions – in his second year, he was sent off three times. In 2006–07 he returned to his region of birth, signing with Gimnàstic de Tarragona and appearing in 16 league games in a season that ended in top-tier relegation.
Veteran Mingo was regularly used by 'Nàstic' in the following four second division campaigns, featuring in a minimum of 21 and a maximum of 29 league matches. He was released at the end of 2011–12, with the club suffering relegation.

*'Akmal Kholmatov' (born 4 April 1976) is a Tajikistani footballer who plays for FC Andijon.
==Career==
===Club===
Kholmatov played for Regar-TadAZ between 1993 and 1996. During 1996 Kholmatov moved to Uzbekistan, signing for Neftchi Fargʻona, and becoming an Uzbek citizen in 2001. After 12 years at Neftchi Fargʻona, Kholmatov moved to fellow Uzbek club Pakhtakor Tashkent for three seasons, before joining Iranian side PAS Hamedan in 2011. A year later Kholmatov returned to Uzbekistan with Lokomotiv Tashkent before rejoining Neftchi Fargʻona in 2014. Kholmatov left Neftchi Fargʻona at the end of the 2015 season. After leaving Neftchi Fargʻona, Kholmatov featured for FC Istiklol in the pre-season friendlies, scoring in a 3–1 defeat to Várda SE in February 2016. In June 2016, Kholmatov left FC Istiklol returning to Neftchi Fargʻona.
====Name controversy====
Kholmatov came under scrutiny in 2007, when the Asian Football Confederation launched an investigation into the identities of two Central Asian players who they believed had falsified documentation to play in AFC competitions. The investigation showed that the two players registered "Akmal Kholmatov" and "Akhmal Holmatov" were actually the same person.
===International===
Kholmatov played for Tajikistan between 2003 and 2007, taking part in their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign.

*"'Have Thine Own Way, Lord'" is a Christian hymn with lyrics by Adelaide A. Pollard and music by George C. Stebbins. It was first published in 1907 in the "Northfield Hymnal with Alexander's Supplement". Later that year, it also appeared in two other popular hymnals, Ira Sankey's "Hallowed Hymns New and Old" and Sankey and Clement's "Best Endeavor Hymns".
==Background==
In 1902, Adelaide A. Pollard was hoping to go to Africa as a missionary but found herself unable to raise the needed funds to make the journey. Greatly discouraged, she attended a prayer service one evening and as she sat there, she overheard an elderly woman say "It really doesn't matter what you do with us, Lord, just have your own way with our lives." The elderly woman inspired Pollard and she contemplated the story of the potter from Jeremiah 18:3 and, upon her return home that evening, wrote all four stanzas before retiring for the night.
Five years later George Stebbins wrote a tune titled "Adelaide" to accompany the text.
==Lyrics==
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
      Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after Thy will;
     While I am waiting, yielded and still.
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
     Search me and try me, Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
     As in Thy presence humbly I bow.
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
     Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
Power, all power, surely is Thine!
     Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
     Hold o’er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit ’till all shall see
     Christ only, always, living in me.
==Recordings==
"Have Thine Own Way, Lord" remains popular and has been recorded by such artists as: Mahalia Jackson, Marty Robbins, Johnny Cash, Eric Copeland, Cristy Lane, Jim Reeves, Eddy Arnold, John Fogerty, Ned Beatty and most, recently by, Ronnie Milsap on his 2009 gospel album, 'Then Sings My Soul'.

* "Have Thine Own Way, Lord" at Glimpses of Christian History'Catharine Hermine Kølle' (29 February 1788 – 27 August 1859) was a Norwegian adventurer, writer and artist.
==Biography==
Catharine Kølle was born at Snarøya  in the parish of Bærum in Akershus, Norway. She was one of three daughters of Christian Kølle (1736–1814) and Elisabeth Monrad (1758–1829). Her father was a language teacher and theologian. In 1803 the family moved to Kopervik on the island of Karmøy in the county of Rogaland, Norway. In 1807 the family moved to  Holmen  in Ulvik in the district of Hardanger, which became the permanent basis for her life.  She received the customary education of young ladies from professional families. She later taught German and French, and some Latin and Italian at a small learning institution which had been founded by her father. Her family lived mostly on fruit growing and farming.
She is known principally as a hiker and artist, as well as for her travel journals.  Between 1826 and 1858, Catharine Kölle carried out at least fifteen long journeys at home and abroad.  She twice traveled by foot to Italy, including trips to Venice in 1841  and Genoa in 1858. She chronicled her travels in journals  which provided documentary material about the places she visited. Her travel journals totaling over 400 pages are maintained at the library of the University Museum of Bergen.
She also painted at least 251 watercolor paintings of which over 200 watercolors  are also maintained at the  University Museum of Bergen. The total list of works contains not only scenes from places she has visited. She also painted the images in the travel descriptions from inaccessible destinations including North America, Guinea,  Istanbul,  Sri Lanka and  Jakarta. Additionally she painted biblical and mythological scenes. Her works are painted in bright, bold colors. They have a naive expression, with accuracy in description of the topography and architecture.

:'The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the debate.  'Please do not modify it.' Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a deletion review). No further edits should be made to this page.'Antonio Pinilla Miranda' (born 25 February 1971) is a Spanish retired footballer who played mainly as a forward.
Best known for his stints with Tenerife and Gimnàstic – he began playing professionally for Barcelona, but had virtually no impact for its first team – he also served as general manager at the latter club, playing in more than 500 official matches for seven different clubs in exactly 20 years, 242 of those in La Liga over the course of 11 seasons (40 goals scored).
==Club career==
===Barcelona===
Born in Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Pinilla was formed in the youth ranks of FC Barcelona. During the 1989–90 season, a week before turning 19, Johan Cruyff gave him the chance to make his La Liga debut, on 18 February 1990 in a match against Rayo Vallecano: he appeared 25 minutes in the 4–1 away win, having come on as a substitute for Julio Salinas.
The following campaign, Barcelona won the league and Pinilla appeared in seven matches, scoring a decisive goal against Valencia CF. He also played in the final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, subbing in for veteran José Ramón Alexanko in a 1–2 loss against Manchester United.
However, strong competition in the emerging 'Dream Team' meant Pinilla had to leave 'Barça' on loan, and he joined RCD Mallorca, scoring four goals in a season which ended in top flight relegation. The following campaign he signed with top level newcomer Albacete Balompié, only missing two games as the Castile-La Mancha club retained its league status.
===Tenerife / Nàstic===
Pinilla was finally released in the summer of 1993, signing for CD Tenerife where he remained seven seasons, helping the Canary Islands team to the semi-finals of the 1996–97 UEFA Cup. He previously entered the club's history books when scoring its first goal ever in European competition, against AJ Auxerre on 15 September 1993; 1998–99 brought with it relegation, and the player followed the side into the second division.
After one season with UD Salamanca, also in the second level, Pinilla joined Catalonia's Gimnàstic de Tarragona, freshly promoted into that tier. His seven goals, however, proved insufficient to prevent the team from being immediately relegated; in addition, a serious knee injury in the final months of the campaign forced him into the operating room which led two a six-month period of inactivity, in turn prompting his release.
After recovering on his own, Pinilla was re-taken by Gimnàstic in the 2003 winter transfer window. Although he barely managed to make the team while they were in division three, he became a basic element in their return to the second level, adding five goals in the last ten days of 2005–06 in an historic return to the top flight.
Pinilla served as captain during Gimnàstic's short-lived spell in the top division, netting twice from 28 appearances for the last-ranked team, against RCD Espanyol (4–0 at home) and against Athletic Bilbao (2–0, away). On 11 September 2007, the club was proclaimed champion of the Catalonia Cup for the first time after a 2–1 defeat of Barcelona – the player, who started the final, netted one of the 'Grana'. 
At the end of the 2007–08 season, after helping 'Nàstic' retain its second tier status, Pinilla announced his retirement after having competed in 200 games overall with the club, promptly being named its general manager and leaving the post in early February 2010.
==International career==
Pinilla never earned one full cap for Spain, but did represent the nation in various youth levels. Additionally, he was a member of the squad that won the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics, appearing in two of six games.
Pinilla also played seven matches with the unofficial Catalonia national team.

*'Robert Lee Sherrod' (February 8, 1909 – February 13, 1994) was an American journalist, editor and author. He was a war correspondent for 'Time' and 'Life' magazines, covering combat from  World War II to the Vietnam War.  During World War II, embedded with the United States Marine Corps, he covered the battles at Attu (with the U.S. Army), Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.  He also authored five books on World War II, including 'Tarawa: The Story of a Battle' (1944) and the definitive 'History of Marine Corps Aviation in World War II' (1952). He was an editor of  'Time' during World War II  and later editor of 'The Saturday Evening Post', then vice-president of Curtis Publishing Company.
==Early years and family==
Robert Lee Sherrod was born on February 8, 1909 in Thomas County, Georgia. He graduated from The University of Georgia in 1929. He was married three times — to Elizabeth Hudson from 1936 until her death in 1958; to Margaret Carson, the prominent American publicist, from 1961 until 1972; and to Mary Gay Labrot Leonhardt from 1972 until her death in 1978. He had two sons, John and Robert L. Jr.
==Journalism career==
After Sherrod's college graduation, he worked for newspapers in the South until 1935, when he joined Time, Inc. In 1940, William Saroyan lists him among "contributing editors" at 'Time' in the play, 'Love's Old Sweet Song'.
During World War II, Sherrod covered the Pacific War for 'TIME' and 'LIFE' magazines — accompanying the Marines into battle at  Attu (with the U.S. Army), Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. After witnessing the carnage at Tarawa, Sherrod was instrumental in advising President Roosevelt to air the controversial documentary With the Marines at Tarawa. Sherrod was one of only a few who were at Tarawa that the President knew personally and could trust to advise him on this matter from the point of view of the Marines on the ground.
In 1943, the Tarawa atoll of the Gilbert Islands was occupied by the Japanese.  Sherrod accompanied the U.S. Marines from their landing on the shores until the battle was over. His book on the battle, 'Tarawa: The Story of a Battle', was published 1944, at which time he was an associate editor of 'TIME'.
Sherrod was also with the Marines during the invasion of Iwo Jima. He wrote,"at the end of a fortnight's bloody fighting there is no longer any doubt that Iwo is the most difficult amphibious operation in U.S. history."
He later wrote the book 'On to Westward: The Battles of Saipan and Iwo Jima' about his experiences on Saipan and Iwo Jima. Unfortunately, Sherrod also admitted to being responsible for spreading the rumor that Joe Rosenthal's famous photograph of the Marines' second flag raising on Mount Suribachi was "staged"; he later confessed that he was wrong and apologized.
He was later a war correspondent in Korea and in Vietnam.
Sherrod was the managing editor for the 'Saturday Evening Post' from 1955 to 1962, then editor from 1962 to 1965. He was vice president of the 'Post's parent company, Curtis Publishing Company, from 1965 to 1966.
==Death==
Sherrod died in his home in Washington, D.C. from emphysema on February 13, 1994.
==Works==
In addition to his work as a war correspondent and editor, Sherrod authored five books on the military, including:

WP:NOT a travel guide. If deemed encyclopedically necessary, a compact list of the stages should first be included in the main article, Via Francigena, before being spun off again.

This is not my content. I just moved it from the Via Francigena page as it was overwhelming the encyclopedic content and did some (very) minor cleaning up as it was so poorly written. I'm not a deletionist so I would leave it so that someone else can clean it up. IMO the travel guide parts of it should go but the stages part can stay.

Servicemen angry at the lavish spending for London's peace parade, held on the same day, following the end of the First World War, protested that the money should be spent on integrating soldiers returning from the war.
==Riot==
The Town Hall in 1897, from George Street, Luton
On Peace Day, 19 July 1919, the Luton Town Hall was burnt down during a riot by ex-servicemen unhappy with unemployment and other grievances. The riot started after members of the council arrived to read out the proclamation of peace, and many in the crowd expressed their disapproval. One issue was veterans not being allowed to hold a drumhead mass in Wardown Park. Tension boiled over into violence, and after a number of clashes, many protesters broke through the police line and forcibly entered the town hall, which was eventually set on fire.
Order was eventually restored to the town by midnight on 19 July, but the fire brigade were unable to extinguish the fire, and by the next morning the town hall was little more than a ruin. The remains of the building were demolished in August 1919 and in 1922 the statue "Peace", designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield, inscribed with the names of more than 280,000 dead servicemen from the Great War, was unveiled.
==Aftermath==
Many of those arrested received serious sentences. John Henry Good who took part in the riots was sentenced to six weeks of hard labour.
In 2019, to commemorate the centenary of the 1919 Peace Riots, Cultural Histories Community Interest Company, working with a number of partner organisations, individuals and local community groups in Luton, developed a range of projects to promote awareness and interest in the 1919 Peace Days riots via a programme of learning and the performing arts. The projects included collecting personal and family recollections of the Peace Riots, plus art and music projects to promote local awareness of the event.

*"'Prelude/Angry Young Man'" is a song written by Billy Joel which appeared as the sixth song on the album 'Turnstiles' in 1976. Live versions have been released as the second track of 'KOHЦEPT', the 11th track of the first disc of '2000 Years: The Millennium Concert', and the opening track on the first disc of '12 Gardens Live' and 'Live at Shea Stadium: The Concert'.  It is also included in the Broadway show 'Movin' Out'.
The instrumental "Prelude" lasts approximately a minute and 43 seconds, starting with a rapid-fire hammered piano riff on the middle-C piano key, joined by various instruments, swinging through styles such an Aaron Copland-styled ballad to funk to a Southwestern beat. According to Joel in an interview with Howard Stern, the rhythm of the fast-paced piano riff was meant to pay homage to the drum part in the song "Wipe Out" by The Surfaris. When performing live, Joel plays the fast-paced prelude himself, but performs the song early in the setlist, largely because the prelude section was easiest to manage during the adrenaline moments of starting a show, as opposed to being attempted after he had already expended much of his energy for other songs.
It is then followed by "Angry Young Man", which paints a slightly sardonic picture of youthful, militant rebellion that is unflagging, trying to fight life's ills despite constant failure ("He refuses to bend, he refuses to crawl / And he's always at home with his back to the wall / And he's proud of his scars and the battles he's lost / And he struggles and bleeds as he hangs on his cross / And he likes to be known as the angry young man"). The song contrasts the angry youth's feelings with the maturity of the narrator, who could be interpreted as either the same angry youth at a later age, or somebody who once felt as the angry young man currently does ("I believe I've passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage / I found that just surviving was a noble fight / I once believed in causes too / I had my pointless point of view / And life went on no matter who was wrong or right".)
Despite never having been released as a single, "Prelude/Angry Young Man" has become a popular song among fans as well as a staple of live shows. "Prelude" was used as an opening theme for the German television talk show 'Live' (1988-1996); and also used as theme song for Grampian Television's summertime news magazine programme "Summer at Six" in the early 1980s. It has also been frequently used during stoppages of play at New York Knicks home games in Madison Square Garden.

Glenn Campbell Stetson was born in the Ottawa Valley (Ramsayville) of eastern Ontario and raised in Hamilton, Ontario. He was a lead singer with The Diamonds, whose hits included "The Stroll", "Silhouettes", and "Little Darlin'", from the late 1960s through the 1990s.  He studied theater under Sir Tyrone Guthrie, and appeared in the original Broadway productions of "H.M.S Pinafore" and "Funny Girl".
In the mid-1960s, he was a featured performer for Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians. He toured Vietnam in 1966 with the USO. In 1968, he joined the Diamonds and helped keep their name and music alive through the 1970s and 1980s and 1990s, particularly on oldies tours and TV. The Diamonds toured Australia heavily in the 1970s with Australian rock-n-roll legend Lonnie Lee.  Stetson released a solo album in the 1970s entitled "Stetson Country" that was produced by Wayne Jackson of the famed Memphis Horns.  He and the Diamonds were frequent guests on Nashville Now with host Ralph Emery.
Stetson and Richard J. "Dick" Milano were founders of Little Darlin's Rock n’ Roll Palace in Kissimmee, Florida (opened in 1986, closed in 1992) which was a highly popular Orlando-area venue in the 1980s. He was co-executive producer for "Live at the Palace" (hosted by Wolfman Jack) on the Nashville Network (TNN).  "Little Darlin's Rock-n-Roll Palace" and associated oldies tours revived the careers of many performers, notably Fabian, Dee Clark, Tommy Sands, The Shirelles, Danny & the Juniors, and The Tokens. He was also active in charitable fund-raising and civic organisations such as the Shriners of which he was an honorary member.
Stetson received a heart transplant in 2000 as a result of myocarditis.  However, his health began to deteriorate and he died undergoing an operation on August 22, 2003 in Orlando, Florida.

*'Comment', I'd be curious to hear from DGG on this one.  That Dewey award might help with notability, but I couldn't find any news coverage on anything apart from the award.  It's worth noting that the article in its current state is extensively copied from his  UCB bio page (the order of sentences is different, but many of the sentences are the same). Nomoskedasticity (talk) 19:44, 2 December 2008 (UTC)
*'Keep' Board member of CLIR is enough to demonstrate notability in the field of academic libraries.  Being head of library is less significant, but given the national reputation he has established in the field, i'd say this at most needs verification and improvement. --Buridan (talk) 21:18, 2 December 2008 (UTC)
*'Keep'. Article needs more citations and references. His service on the boards of visitors of various universities, including prestigious ones, probably qualifies him as notable under WP:PROF criterion 4 (work has made a significant impact in the area of higher education, affecting a substantial number of academic institutions). There is also evidence of either passing, or being very close to passing criterion 6 (elected or appointed academic post at an academic institution or major academic society).--Eric Yurken (talk) 23:22, 2 December 2008 (UTC)
*'Comment'. It seems that the first AfD, which led to deletion, was for someone else. There the nom refers to a “non-notable artist”.--Eric Yurken (talk) 23:24, 2 December 2008 (UTC)
*'Keep'. Not altogether sure about this and would like to hear DGG's opinion, but as Eric Yurken noted, this does seem to pass criterion 4 of WP:PROF. In particular, there is a fairly prestigious award from the American Library Association that he got in 2002. I did add a couple of references to the article. Nsk92 (talk) 16:38, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

It also features Mansoor Ali Khan, Rupini, Livingston and Ramya Krishnan, while R. Sarathkumar appears in a cameo role. It was Vijayakanth's 100th film, after which he earned the sobriquet "captain".
The character of the antagonist Veerabhadran, played by Mansoor Ali Khan, is loosely based on the forest brigand Veerappan. The title of the film was inspired from Velupillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Upon its release, the film became a blockbuster at the box office. The film score and soundtrack were composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu as 'Captain Prabhakar'.
==Plot==
Captain Prabhakaran (Vijayakanth) is an IFS officer (Indian Forest Service) sent to Sathyamangalam to nab Veerabhadran (Mansoor Ali Khan) who tortures the people of that place. Prabhakaran is not only going to nab Veerabhadran, but also avenge the death of his friend Rajaraman IFS (R. Sarathkumar) who was a forest officer killed by Veerabhadran. The police commissioner and the district collector are corrupt and also support Veerabhadran. In the climax, Veerabhadran kidnaps Prabhakaran's wife and son. Prabhakaran arrives at the right time and saves his wife and son. He then nabs Veerabhadran. Poongudi (Ramya Krishnan) was Rajaraman's lover.  She dies while giving birth to his child. Veerabhadran is shot dead by the corrupt inspector and collector. Prabhakaran kills both of them. He is then dragged to court for killing the police inspector and the collector. Prabhakaran tells the truth that they were corrupt, and the film ends with Prabhakaran being released from the court.
==Cast==
* Vijayakanth as Captain Prabhakaran IFS, District forest officer
* Sarath Kumar as Rajaraman IFS
* M.N. Nambiar as Police Officer in charge of Special Task Force
* Rupini as Gayathri
* Ramya Krishnan as Poongudi
* Mansoor Ali Khan as Veerabhadran
* Livingston as Krishnamurthy/Kitti
*Peeli Sivam as Raja
*Ganthimathi as Prabhakaran's Mother
*Yuvasri as Rajaraman's Sister
*Krishnamoorthy as Poongudi's Brother
*Ponnambalam as Sub Inspector (uncredited)

*Kalabhavan Mani (Junior artist)
==Production==
After the success of 'Pulan Visaranai', Rowther decided to make another project with Vijayakanth and Selvamani titled 'Captain Prabhakaran', the plotline of the film was based on the forest brigand Veerappan. The film also was the 100th project of Vijayakanth. The filming was held at Chalakudy for 60 days. The film had Mansoor Ali Khan in his first major role. During the shoot, a rope to which Vijayakanth was bound snapped and his shoulder got dislocated. With both his hands tied he screamed in pain, but this was mistaken for acting, and as a result, there was a delay in getting medical assistance.
==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack has only two songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja while the lyrics were written by Gangai Amaran and Piraisoodan. The song "Aattama Therottama" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Sindhu Bhairavi. It was later remixed by Prasanna Sekhar in 'Singakutty' (2008).
==Reception==
'The Indian Express' wrote "The strength of the film is its visual vibrancy and the narrative line too has a great measure of cohesion, despie it being an action film all the way."

===Leek soup===

Where there are leeks there is leek soup.  This is an unremarkable soup, surely not notable.  It should be transwikied to Wiktionary and removed from Wikipedia.  It is a dicdef.  Anyone creating a soup out of salt, water and leeks with no added ingredients will find they have salty leeky water, too, rather than a pleasant soup. Fiddle Faddle (talk) 11:01, 30 November 2008 (UTC)
* 'Merge' with Leek for now (probably a new bullet point under to existing three in cuisine will do). There probably is enough references to leek soup out there for an article if anyone wants to write one, but a simple recipe isn't enough to warrant a separate article. (Might be a case for an article on Leek recipes though.) Chris Neville-Smith (talk) 11:09, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

*'Delete' -- no google news hits (all dates option), with either spelling of shaykh/sheikh.  I've also checked various permutations -- no hyphens at all, hyphen only with ul-Aqtab, "Shaykh Zain", "Shaykh Siddiqi" (and both with sheikh).  The fact that this guy is English also lessens the concerns we might have about the spelling of his name.  Nomoskedasticity (talk) 22:57, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
*'Delete'. I could not find anything that would suggest he passes WP:PROF. Wikipedia has only a few articles about Shaykh’s. These are usually for individuals with scholarship accomplishments that would qualify them under WP:PROF or for notability under other WP:N categories. That is, its seems that just being a Shaykh would not be enough to automatically qualify someone as notable under WP:N.--Eric Yurken (talk) 23:21, 2 December 2008 (UTC)

*'Ljubiša Ranković' (; born 10 December 1973) is a Serbian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.
==Playing career==
After playing for Rad in the First League of FR Yugoslavia over one and a half seasons, Ranković was transferred abroad to South Korean club Ilhwa Chunma in October 1995, helping the team win the Asian Club Championship in December of that year. He later made 12 appearances in the 1996 K League.
Following his stint in Asia, Ranković joined Partizan in early 1997. He spent seven seasons with the 'Crno-beli', including loan spells to Chinese club Sichuan Dahe in 2002, as well as to fellow Serbian club Zemun in 2003. Subsequently, Ranković moved abroad to France and joined Ligue 2 side Caen. He helped them earn promotion to Ligue 1 in his first season at the club. However, as they immediately suffered relegation from the top flight, Ranković left the country and signed for Ukrainian club Metalurh Zaporizhya in the summer of 2005. He returned to French football six months later and joined Ligue 2 club Sète, before hanging up his boots in 2006.
==Post-playing career==
After retiring from the game, Ranković was a member of technical staff at his former club Partizan for seven years, before joining Belarusian side Dinamo Minsk as assistant manager to Dušan Uhrin Jr. ahead of the 2015 season. He was brought to the club by newly appointed director of football Vuk Rašović. After Rašović replaced Uhrin as manager, Ranković remained serving as an assistant. He returned to Partizan in August 2016, becoming assistant manager to Marko Nikolić. In June 2017, Ranković joined Aleksandar Stanojević in Greece as his assistant at PAOK. He rejoined Partizan in October 2017 to assist Miroslav Đukić. In April 2018, Ranković became assistant manager to Mladen Krstajić with the Serbia national team, less than two months ahead of the 2018 World Cup. He also continued to assist Đukić at Partizan until the end of the season. In June 2018, it was announced that Ranković would be joining Vuk Rašović as an assistant at Emirati club Al Dhafra.

The small size of nanomagnets prevents the formation of magnetic domains (see single domain (magnetic)). The magnetization dynamics of sufficiently small nanomagnets at low temperatures, typically single-molecule magnets, presents quantum phenomena, such as macroscopic spin tunnelling. At larger temperatures, the magnetization undergoes random thermal fluctuations (superparamagnetism) which present a limit for the use of nanomagnets for permanent information storage.
Canonical examples of nanomagnets are grains of ferromagnetic metals (iron, cobalt, and nickel) and single-molecule magnets. The vast majority of nanomagnets feature transition metal (titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt or nickel) or rare earth (Gadolinium, Europium, Erbium) magnetic atoms.
The ultimate limit in miniaturization of nanomagnets was achieved in 2016:   individual Ho atoms  present remanence when  deposited on a atomically thin layer of MgO coating a silver film was reported by scientists from EPFL and ETH, in Switzerland.  Before that, the  smallest nanomagnets reported so far, attending to the number of magnetic atoms, were double decker phthalocyanes  molecules with only one rare-earth atom.  Other  systems presenting remanence are nanoengineered Fe chains, deposited on Cu2N/Cu(100) surfaces, showing either Neel  or ferromagnetic ground states with in systems with as few as 5  Fe atoms with S=2.  Canonical single-molecule magnets are the so-called Mn12 and Fe8 systems, with 12 and 8 transition metal atoms each and both with spin 10 (S = 10) ground states.
The phenomenon of zero field magnetization requires three conditions:
# A ground state with finite spin
# A magnetic anisotropy energy barrier
# Long spin relaxation time.
Conditions 1 and 2, but not 3, have been demonstrated in a number of nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, nanoislands, and quantum dots with a controlled number of magnetic atoms (between 1 and 10).

Stearns' (May 2, 1853 – June 2, 1936) was an American politician, attorney, and jurist in Oregon. Born in New Hampshire and raised in Oregon, he became a lawyer and practiced in Portland. A Republican, he was a member of the Oregon House of Representatives and later a judge for several courts.
==Early life==
Loyal Stearns was born to Daniel W. Stearns and Almira Stearns (nee Fay) on May 2, 1853. One of five children, he was born in Swanzey, New Hampshire, and sailed with his family that year via the Isthmus of Panama route to San Francisco, California. In 1854, they continued north to the Oregon Territory. There they settled in Southern Oregon in Scottsburg. The younger Stearns was educated in Roseburg at the local schools and at Umpqua Academy. He also traveled around the state and into Idaho while working with his merchant father.
In 1871, Stearns relocated north to Portland where he attended Bishop Scott Academy until 1872. Stearns then enrolled at the Willamette University College of Medicine in Salem, Oregon, for one term before leaving to study law. He read law under the guidance of A. C. Gibbs and William Ball Gilbert at their law firm in Portland beginning in 1873. In December 1876, he passed the bar and began practicing law in Portland. Stearns started as a partner of Gibbs before practicing on his own.
==Political career==
Stearns was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1878 as a Republican. He represented District 38 which at that time was located entirely within Multnomah County, and included Portland. His father Daniel Stearns served in the House previously, and then served in the state senate following Loyal's one session in the Oregon Legislative Assembly. Loyal Stearns then served as Portland’s police judge from January 1879 to 1882 followed by election to the office of city attorney. After a short time in that position, he was elected to a seat on Multnomah County’s court, and served from June 1882 to 1885. In 1885, he became a judge for the Oregon circuit court where he remained until 1898. Governor Zenas Ferry Moody appointed him to the position, and Stearns won election to a full-term and then re-election until retiring from the bench.
==Later years and family==
On June 19, 1883, he married Mary Frances Hoyt, and they had one daughter together. Stearns worked in the real estate business following his judicial career. Mary, the daughter of Captain Richard Hoyt, died in 1933. Loyal Stearns died on June 2, 1936, at the age of 83.

'Tkalčićeva Street' (, formally: 'Ivan Tkalčić Street', ) is a street in the Zagreb, Croatia city center. Extending from the vicinity of the central Ban Jelačić Square to its northern end at the Little Street (), the street flows between the Gornji Grad in the west and Nova Ves in the east. The street is administratively within the Gornji Grad–Medveščak city district, constituting the former "August Cesarec" commune (abolished in 1994). According to the 2001 Croatian census, the street has 1,591 inhabitants.
==History==
Centuries before the today's street emerged, the route of Tkalčićeva Street was covered by the Medveščak creek. Medveščak (at that time also called Crikvenik or Cirkvenik) had been the center of Zagreb industry since the early days of the city, spawning numerous watermills. The watermills caused the development of Zagreb industry, leading in turn to the construction of Zagreb's first cloth, soap, paper and liquor factories and, later, animal skin industry. The watermills were often the subject of feuds between the twin cities, Kaptol and Gradec. A 1392 peace treaty forbade construction of new watermills along the shared city border, between today's southern end of Medvedgradska Street and Ban Jelačić Square, leaving only two mills within the city. Both mills were owned by a Cistercian monastery. However, they were both razed during the 1898 covering of the creek.
Street pianist in the Tkalčićeva street.
Although both sides of the creek had been inhabited before, the 1898 covering left a full-scale street, which was aptly named Ulica Potok (). Most of the houses were dated to 18th or 19th century and the street was surfaced with gravel from Sava River excavated in Trnje. Around the middle of the 20th century it was modernized and paved with asphalt. The creek-based industry was quickly transformed into small businesses and stores and the skin industry stopped working in 1938. 
According to several records, the transformation of Medveščak creek valley was orchestrated in 1900 by Milan Lenucci, an architect. In 1908, Viktor Kovačić displayed some of his ideas about Ulica Potok in his studies of Gornji Grad, Kaptol and other city neighborhoods. In 1913, Ulica Potok's name is changed to Tkalčićeva Street in honor of the 19th century Zagreb historian Ivan Tkalčić, who was from nearby Nova Ves.
==Red-light district==
At the turn of the 20th century, prostitution was legal. In Zagreb it was advertised as a tourist attraction and contributed to the city's economy. Tkalčićeva Street was the main centre for brothels. At one stage every other building was a bordello. To open a brothel, the owner had to register at the town hall and received a licence. The licence required the brothel to be well run and provide a quality service. The women working in the brothels had to have a twice weekly medical examination. Brothels were not allowed to advertise their presence, but a discrete, uncommonly coloured lantern was allowed to be placed outside.
The best known brothel, and most expensive, was the 'Kod Zelene Lampe' (Green Lantern’s). The street's brothels continued to operate until WW2.

She was the third wife of tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. She was the mother of tsar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria.
== Life ==
Irene was daughter of 'despotēs' Theodore Komnenos Doukas, ruler of Epirus, and Maria Petraliphaina (sister of the 'sebastokratōr' John Petraliphas). In 1230 Irene and her family were captured by the troops of tsar Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria in the battle of Klokotnitsa and they were taken in Tarnovo, where Irene grew up in the Palace. Irene became known for her beauty and the widowed tsar fell in love with her. They married in 1237. According to a Byzantine author, Ivan Asen II loved Irene "no less than Antony loved Cleopatra", and she may have been his mistress for some years before their marriage in 1237. By marrying Irene, Ivan Asen II would have broken church canons, as his daughter, Maria Asanina Komnena, from his marriage to Anna (Anisia) was married to Irene's uncle, Manuel of Thessalonica. There is some evidence that the Bulgarian church opposed the marriage and that a patriarch (called either Spiridon or Vissarion) was deposed or executed by the irate tsar.
Irene and Ivan Asen II had three children:
# Anna (or Theodora), who married the 'sebastokratōr' Peter before 1253.
# Maria, who married Mitso Asen, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria 1256–1257.
# Michael Asen I, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria (1246–1256).
In 1241 Ivan Asen II died and he was succeeded by Kaliman I of Bulgaria, his son by his second wife Anna Maria of Hungary. Kaliman I was poisoned in 1246 and the throne went to Michael Asen I, the son of Irene. According to one theory Irene poisoned her stepson in order to secure the throne for Michael II. It is assumed that Irene took over the government as tsarina-regent because her son was still a child when he ascended the throne, but there is little evidence to prove this hypothesis.
Irene retired to a monastery under the monastic name Xenia. She was expelled from Bulgaria after the death of her son in 1256 and spent the rest of her life in her family's land around Thessaloniki.

*'Creole' is a lightweight markup language, aimed at being a common markup language for wikis, enabling and simplifying the transfer of content between different wiki engines.
==History==
The idea was conceived during a workshop at the 2006 International Symposium on Wikis.  An EBNF grammar and XML interchange format for Creole have also been published. Creole was designed by comparing major wiki engines and using the most common markup for a particular wikitext element. If no commonality was found, the wikitext of the dominant wiki engine MediaWiki was usually chosen.
On July 4, 2007, the version 1.0 (final) of Creole was released, and a two-year development freeze was implemented to allow time for authors of wiki engines to adopt the new markup. Although development to the standard itself is frozen, discussion in the developer community regarding good practices in wiki markup design and about possible additions and changes for future Creole versions continues.
As of 2012, adoption of Creole is limited.  Many wiki systems offer it as an option, but few use it by default and few wiki websites enable this optional feature.

As of early 2011, wiki engines that have implemented full or partial support for Creole include Liferay, Djiki, DokuWiki, Ikiwiki, MoinMoin, Oddmuse, PhpWiki, PmWiki, TiddlyWiki, and XWiki. However, Creole is not necessarily the default syntax in these wiki engines.
Creole 1.0 is the default syntax in Bitbucket wikis, which also support some Creole 1.0 additions.
Creole 1.0 is one of the available markup languages for the online educational platform Moodle,
and the UML rendering software PlantUML.

It was first reported as 'dehydromucic acid' by Rudolph Fittig and Heinzelmann in 1876, who produced it via the action of concentrated hydrobromic acid upon mucic acid.  It can be produced from certain carbohydrates and as such is a renewable resource, it was identified by the US Department of Energy as one of 12 priority chemicals for establishing the “green” chemistry industry of the future. 
Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) has been suggested as an important renewable building block because it can substitute for terephthalic acid (PTA) in the production of polyesters and other current polymers containing an aromatic moiety.
==Synthesis of FDCA==
Methods for the synthesis of the FDCA may be divided into four groups:
* Dehydration of hexose derivatives
* Oxidation of 2,5-disubstituted furans
* Catalytic conversions of various furan derivatives
* Biological conversion of HMF
===Dehydration of hexose derivatives===
First group is based on the acid-promoted triple dehydration of aldaric (mucic) acids. This reaction requires severe conditions (highly concentrated acids, temp > 120 °C, React time > 20h) and all the methods were non-selective with yields 2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+; it is utilized in medicine to remove kidney stones. HMF is metabolized via FDCA in mammals including humans. A very diluted solution of FDCA in tetrahydrofuran is utilized for preparing artificial veins for transplantation. At the beginning of this chapter, it was mentioned that FDCA is a chemically stable compound. This property has been well benefited in industry – FDCA as most of polycarboxylic acids can be an ingredient of fire foams. Such foams help to extinguish fires in a short time caused by polar and non-polar solvents.
FDCA has a large potential as a replacement for terephthalic acid, a widely used component in various polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutyleneterephthalate (PBT). The versatility of FDCA is also seen in the number of derivatives available via relatively simple chemical transformations. Selective reduction can lead to partially hydrogenated products, such as 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran, and fully hydrogenated materials, such as 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran. Both of these latter materials can serve as alcohol components in the production of new polyester, and their combination with FDCA would lead to a new family of completely biomass-derived products. Extension of these concepts to the production of new nylons, either through reaction of FDCA with diamines, or through the conversion of FDCA to 2,5-bis(aminomethyl)tetrahydrofuran. FDCA can also serve as a starting material for the production of succinic acid, whose utility is elsewhere.
==Technical barriers==
The primary technical barrier in the production and use of FDCA is the development of an effective and selective dehydration process from sugars. The control of sugar dehydration could be a very powerful technology, leading to a wide range of additional, inexpensive building blocks, but it is not yet well understood. Currently, dehydration processes using hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as intermediate are generally non-selective, unless, immediately upon their formation, the unstable intermediate products can be transformed into more stable materials such as methoxymethylfurfural (MMF). Necessary R&D will include development of selective dehydration systems and catalysts.

*18 of its members (3 for each state) were elected at the 28 September 1946 election, the last election under the plurality-at-large voting system where the Australian Labor Party had won 15 of the 18 seats. These Senators had terms starting on 1 July 1947 and due to finish on 30 June 1953.
*42 of its members (7 for each state) were elected at the 10 December 1949 election, which was the first election conducted with a single transferable vote under a proportional voting system. The Senators were divided into two classes:
**30 of its members (5 for each state) had terms starting on 1 July 1950 and due to finish on 30 June 1956. The 18 senators elected in the 21 August 1943 election served until their terms ended on 30 June 1950.
**12 of its members (2 for each state) had terms starting on 22 February 1950 (the day the term of the House of Representatives began) and due to finish on 30 June 1953.
Labor retained a Senate majority at the election. The Senate was dissolved for the 1951 election, which was a double dissolution. Labor has not held a Senate majority since.

*The 'Army Correspondence Course Program' ('ACCP') is a type of distance education and the formal nonresident extension of the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) service schools' curriculum.
==Overview==
DA Pamphlet 351-20, The Army Correspondence Course Program Catalog, is an Army publication. The catalog lists all correspondence courses developed and administered by the Army and select Department of Defense activities. The Army Institute for Professional Development (AIPD) publishes a yearly revision of the catalog each October to update the ACCP curriculum and any procedural changes to the program. The entire ACCP curriculum and an electronic enrollment form are also listed at the Army Training Support Center’s Web site. The ACCP Catalog offers two types of study: individual and group.
AIPD's automated student record system limits students to one course enrollment, or to one course enrollment and a subcourse enrollment, at any one time. But, this limitation applies only to the courses and subcourses administered by AIPD. Each subcourse is awarded a specific number of credit hours, noted in ACCP Catalog Chapter 3 at the individual subcourse descriptions and usually included on the title page of a subcourse. The number of credit hours for any given subcourse is based on the estimated time required for a student to read the material and complete all practice exercises and the examination.
There are several Army e Learning programs, a few of which are:
* eArmyU – which allows you to take college classes in your off-duty time and can ably assist you in preparing for a future non-military job.
* DANTES – which stands for Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support and it provides personnel with educational opportunities that are both practical and compatible with life in the military. This form of long distance learning is an innovative way to keep deployed troops alert, informed, and entertained by implementing satellite, video, and now even Podcast courses.http://army-e-learning.net/

He made his debut on May 14, and in 25 games he had a 3–8 win-loss record and a 4.47 earned run average (ERA). In 1923, he spent some time as a starting pitcher and some as a relief pitcher. In 38 games, 21 of them starts, he had a 10–10 record and a 3.71 ERA in 179.1 innings pitched.
In 1924, Edwards pitched in 10 games for the Indians, and had a 4–3 record and a 2.84 ERA. After 13 games and an ERA of 8.25 the following season, he was released and picked up by the Chicago White Sox, pitching in nine games towards the end of the season. Edwards spent the 1926 season with the White Sox, and had a 6–9 record and a 4.18 ERA in 32 games, 16 of them starts. In 1927, he had his first taste of minor league baseball, and spent the year with the Seattle Indians. In 41 games for them, he had a 20–17 record and a 3.36 ERA. The following season he had a 1–8 record and a 3.14 ERA in ten games. The Cincinnati Reds signed him to a contract during part of the 1928 season, and in his last season in the majors, he had a 2–2 record and a 7.59 ERA in 18 appearances. He then spent four more seasons in the minor leagues to end his professional career. In a six-season career, Edwards posted a 26–37 record with 211 strikeouts and a 4.37 ERA in 145 appearances, including 59 starts, 23 complete games, six shutouts, four saves, and  innings of work.

== History ==
===Foundation===
On 28 April 2008 Lufthansa announced plans to commence intra-European flights out of Milan–Malpensa Airport using six Embraer 195 aircraft from its subsidiary Air Dolomiti.
On 26 November 2008 the new brand Lufthansa Italia was formed instead of the originally planned Air Dolomiti operations. Operations started on 2 February 2009 using the larger Airbus A319-100. The new subsidiary was established to allow Lufthansa to better tap into the lucrative North Italian market that was all but abandoned by Alitalia during a series of cutbacks. The airline's on board cuisine was aimed towards the Italian market, with Italian foods and drinks. For example, in business class, Italian espresso was served.

On 23 July 2011, Lufthansa reported in a press release that it would stop all Lufthansa Italia operations by 29 October 2011 as it had been proven too difficult to operate the Italian-based operations economically. As a replacement, the Lufthansa Group increased their flights from Italian destinations to their German hubs in Frankfurt and Munich instead. The last scheduled flight of Lufthansa Italia was LH3627 on 29 October 2011, which landed at 16:35, coming from Palermo to Milan-Malpensa, which was flown on the Airbus A319-100 with the registration D-AKNJ. The former Lufthansa Italia aircraft have been transferred back to other Lufthansa Group airlines.

Five of the airline's aircraft came from Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, and the other five came from Lufthansa's base at Munich. All aircraft were given names of Italian cities, such as 'Bologna' and 'Varese', and were painted in a modified Lufthansa livery. The aircraft retained their German registrations. In 2010, the airline planned to replace one A319 with two Airbus A320, but this never occurred. Two of the five daily flights to London were operated by a British Midland International Airbus A321 in a 31/118 configuration.

* -  German version, Italian version linked from English pageA 'vertical slice' from the components of a project
A 'vertical slice', sometimes abbreviated to 'VS', is a type of milestone, benchmark, or deadline, with emphasis on demonstrating progress across all components of a project. It may have originated in the video game industry.
The term "vertical slice" refers to a cross-sectional slice through the layers that form the structure of the software code base. It is mostly used in Scrum terminology where the work is planned in terms of features (or stories). For example, as a very basic approach, a software project may consist of three layers (or components):
# Data access layer (bottom)
# Business logic layer (middle)
# User interface layer (top)
In this common approach, a vertical slice means a bit of every layer. Again as an example, a new feature request like "showing x information on main screen" would contain these work bits:
* Work in the UX/UI that will display the information
* Work in the service layer to transform the information
* Work in the database layer to store / fetch the information.
So a vertical slice can be defined as "the sum of the work that has to be done in every layer that is involved in getting a specific feature working." A vertical slice doesn't necessarily affect every component in the software. For example, if the solution contains a web service, it would live in the same "floor" as the UI, and a feature like "supporting login/logout in webservice" that involves only the web service does not require a change in the UI, but the business and database access layers.
Visualizing the layers of a vertical slice.
Begin to show how vertical slicing works.
UX/UI for vertical "Login User" story
Using the Java ATG framework it takes 14 files to make the login work. Tasking is important to get as accurate as you can with estimating.
==Vertical User Stories==
A vertical user story encapsulates the action of one function.
==Writing Vertical User Stories==
Below is an example of a vertical user story:'As an end user I must be able to log into my company portal so that I can perform the functions of my job.'
===Acceptance Criteria===
Acceptance criteria are conditions of satisfaction. This story is "done" when the detailed functionalities are completed. 
; Example
* Verify that I can log into the system
* Verify that my login credentials will be remembered
* Verify that I can reset my own password by clicking the "Forgot Password" link
* Verify that I cannot navigate back to the landing page without first logging in
===Dissected by Layer===
As a developer, you will need to think about every file encapsulated in each layer that needs to be created and/or extended in order to complete this "Login User" story.

----'Martin Charles Strong' (born 1960 in Musselburgh) is a Scottish music historian known for compiling discographies of popular music including 'The Great Rock Discography'. Strong has been described in broadsheet newspaper profiles as a "compiler of acclaimed mammoth discographies" and "a man who knows more about rock music than is healthy for one individual".
==Career==
Strong has researched music extensively since the early 1980s, dedicating 70 hours per week to his craft as of 2004.
He is perhaps best known for 'The Great Rock Discography', with the 7th edition being published in 2004; the foreword was penned by disc jockey John Peel. The book has garnered acclaim, with United States music critic Robert Christgau recommending it as one of the three best rock music encyclopaedias, and the one with the "maddest completism". Author Ian Rankin named it as one of the "5 Books Every Man Should Read", calling it "a great book" that "would keep him happy on any desert island". It was re-released as 'The Essential Rock Discography', a condensed version, in 2006.
Strong has also authored 'The Great Metal Discography' (2 editions), 'The Great Psychedelic', 'The Great Alternative & Indie' (2 volumes) and 'Lights, Camera, Soundtracks' (with Brendon Griffin). Along with 'The Great/Essential Rock Discography' – on which Griffin also worked sporadically – these titles have been published by Canongate Books. Mercat Press published a history of Scottish contemporary music, 'The Great Scots Musicography', in 2002. Strong's final tomes were two volumes of 'The Great Folk Discography', published by Birlinn in 2010 and 2011; a third part of the trilogy, 'The Great Folk Discography: The Celtic Connections', has been shelved. He maintains the online resource,  The Great Rock Bible.
Aside from his books, Strong has written for 'The List', 'Record Collector', 'Songlines', 'HMV Choice' and the Rough Guides series. He served as researcher for Jimmy Cliff's 2003 'Anthology' release.
==Personal life==
Strong lives in Falkirk and has three daughters.

* International Plant Names refThe 'Westland Dreadnought' was an experimental single-engined fixed-wing monoplane design for a mail plane created to test the aerodynamic wing and fuselage design ideas of Woyevodsky. It was designed and built by British aircraft manufacturer Westland Aircraft for the Air Ministry. Only a single aircraft was built and it crashed on its initial flight, badly injuring the test pilot.
==Design and development==
The Dreadnought was distinct for its futuristic design and method of construction, based on the theories of the Russian inventor N. Woyevodsky. After preliminary tests of the idea were tried in a wind tunnel and met with some degree of success, the design was given to Westland Aircraft to construct an aircraft. The design at the time was for a 70 ft wingspan twin-engine aircraft. The design was aerodynamically advanced, featuring a continuous aerofoil section over all parts of the aircraft, including the fuselage and unusually for British aircraft at that time, had no form of wing bracing. Construction was all-metal, comprising drawn channeling with a skin of corrugated sheet panels. The method may be compared to the modern stressed skin construction. Although conceived as a twin-engined type with retractable undercarriage, the design that emerged was fitted with a 450-horsepower Napier Lion II 12 cylinder engine that allowed the Dreadnought speeds of up to 102 miles per hour and fixed undercarriage.
==Operational history==
On completion of the Dreadnought, the pilot Arthur Keep carried out taxi trials and short airborne hops. On 9 May 1924, he took off for its first flight test. The aircraft was initially stable, it soon became clear that Keep was losing control and not long after, at a height of about , the Dreadnought stalled and crashed. Thrown from the aircraft, Keep suffered severe injuries and later had both legs amputated. He remained with the company and did not retire until 1935. After this failure, the Dreadnought design was abandoned, although the ideas that were conceived and used in its making were visibly an advancement in aircraft and are appreciated as such in the present day.

Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a deletion review). No further edits should be made to this page.'Great Naval Battles' is a series of computer games by Strategic Simulations which simulate combat between naval vessels. It consist of five separate games, four of which  depict various phases of World War II. Each game combines a wider view of the action on a fleet scale, as well as controls for individual ships. SSI covered similar themes in another naval game, 'Fighting Steel', which was released afterwards, in 1999.
==Games in series==
The game series contains the following games:
:* 'Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939-1943' was released in 1992 and depicts naval warfare in the North Atlantic during World War 2.
:* 'Great Naval Battles: Guadalcanal 1942-1943' depicts naval combat in the Pacific Ocean during World War 2.
:* 'Great Naval Battles Vol. III: Fury in the Pacific, 1941–1944' is a direct sequel to #2 and depicts the remainder of the Pacific Ocean war. It was not considered to be as strong a product as the previous two games, as it had some problems with bugs. the game structure was problematic due to some attempts to include air combat.
:* 'Great Naval Battles 4: Burning Steel 1939–1942' was released in 1995 and constituted a major overhaul of the game. It utilized entirely new procedures and interfaces. Several new features were provided, including the ability to full customize each combat scenario.
:* 'Great Naval Battles V: Demise of the Dreadnoughts; 1914–18' is set in World War I, and does not include aircraft. It was only sold in the boxed set 'Great Naval Battles – the Final Fury', which contained all games of the series plus GNBNA.
==Gameplay and dynamics==
Every game provides a choice between individual ship views and fleet command views. Players can choose individual stations to operate during the game.
==Background music==
===Great Naval Battles: North Atlantic 1939–1943===
When "British" is being selected for the gameplay, 'Rule Britannia' is being played. Whereas if "German" is being selected, 'Unter dem Doppeladler' is being played.

It is one of the Norwich 12, a collection of twelve heritage buildings in Norwich deemed of particular historical and cultural importance. It is Grade II* listed.
==History==
The new City Hall saw the demolition in Norwich of Tudor, Regency and Victorian buildings on St Peters Street and the Market Place, including many yards and dilapidated municipal buildings. The architects Charles Holloway James and Stephen Rowland Pierce, designed the building after Robert Atkinson had prepared a layout for the whole Civic Centre site at the request of Norwich Corporation (now the City Council). A competition took place in 1931 which attracted 143 entries, with Atkinson as the sole judge. After the winning design was chosen the Depression and a protracted planning process delayed the start of the building, and the foundation stone was not laid until 1936. Norwich City Hall was officially opened by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on 29 October 1938.
==Architecture==
Alfred Hardiman.
The architects designed for Norwich an Art Deco public building of national significance. It was built to the highest standards, using superior materials and methods of its day. Even the bricks were specially made, each one being two inches longer than usual to better reflect the proportions of the finished building. Charles Holloway James and Stephen Rowland Pierce engaged Alfred Hardiman as their consultant sculptor. He contributed the iconic lions passant which guard the building, and three figures of Recreation, Wisdom and Education outside the Council Chamber. His colleague James Woodford designed the six main bronze doors, incorporating 18 roundels showing the history and industry of Norwich. Eric Aumonier carved the city arms above the Regalia Room window on Bethel Street, and Margaret Calkin James provided textiles for some of the important rooms.
The materials used include Italian marble and English stone, Honduras mahogany and Australian walnut. Seating is upholstered in Moroccan leather, and rooms panelled in elm, oak, teak and birch. The Lord Mayor’s octagonal parlour is panelled in sycamore with French walnut trim, with the door finished in English walnut. The main frontage of the building is 280 feet long, incorporating a 200ft balcony. The city council claims that the balcony is the longest such structure in the UK. Meanwhile, the bell in the clock tower has the deepest tone in East Anglia.

==History==
A Cornish cross in the cemetery
Sennen parish church is dedicated to St Sinninus but has also been dedicated to St John the Baptist. There has been a church here since at least the 15th century. In 1327 and 1430 the patron of Sennen is described as a female saint Senana. However in later times it has been assumed that Senanus is the patron saint. The identification of this Cornish saint with St Senan of Scattery Island appears to have no foundation. 
The church of St. Sennen is mediaeval. A visit by members of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society on their annual excursion in August 1893 resulted in a translation of a Latin inscription on a stone at the base of the font as ″'In the year of the Lord 1441 2, 3, or 4, this Church was dedicated on the festival of the beheading of St John the Baptist'″. (The feast referred to is celebrated on 29 August.) It is known as the parish church of Land's End and the patron is the Duke of Cornwall.
The present church has a chancel and nave, a south aisle and a north transept. A wall-painting depicting two round embattled towers was uncovered during restoration in 1867. There is also a headless alabaster figure representing the Virgin Mary in the transept. The church has a three-stage battlemented tower housing a ring of three bells.
There are five Cornish crosses in the parish. One is at Escalls and another at Sennen Green. Trevilley cross is one of only two crosses with a crucifixus figure on a cross carved onto the stone (there is a cross on the other side of the head). A cross on the churchyard wall came from a site near the Giant's Stone. A fine cross in the cemetery adjoining the churchyard was found in use as a footbridge near Trevear and moved to the churchyard in 1878. About 1890 it was moved to its present position.
==References==Cover of 'Dr Xargle's Book of Earthlets', first in the series (1988), art by Tony Ross
'Dr. Xargle'  is a series of children's picture books written by Jeanne Willis and illustrated by Tony Ross; the original six books were published by Andersen Press from 1988 to 1993. It features an alien perspective on human civilization, especially the life of British children and their families. Alternatively, Dr. Xargle is the main character, an alien who studies Earth and teaches schoolchildren about it. Sometimes he takes them on field trips to Earth in human disguises. Finally, 'Dr. Xargle' is a 1997 British television series based on the original books. 
For the third book in the series, 'Dr. Xargle's Book of Earth Tiggers' (1990), Ross was highly commended runner up for the annual Kate Greenaway Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a British subject.
== Books ==
All seven books were published in hardcover editions by Andersen Press. The original series was published in British paperback editions by Red Fox (Random House) within a few years. In the United States, the books have titles such as 'Earthlets, as explained by Professor Xargle'—the first book, published by E. P. Dutton in 1989.

== Television series ==
A 13-episode television series was produced by CINAR and King Rollo Films, and broadcast in 1997: Dr. Xargle and his students are animatronic puppets, while the students' lessons about Earth are animated.
Unnamed in the books, the planet was identified as Planet Queeg, and the children were called Queegles. It is unclear whether their species is named Queegle, or this is the name for their infants (the adults being called Queegs).

In 2003 all of the Arrows A23 chassis and the full Arrows Grand Prix International intellectual property rights were bought by Minardi. The Arrows A23 was renamed the Minardi PS04A and in back-to-back tests it was found superior to the Minardi's PS03. Minardi however decide that they could not run a "pure-Arrows" and hence used the Arrows intellectual property, which included the new designs for the Arrows A24 and the best elements from the PS03 and PS04A / Arrows A23 to develop the Minardi PS04B for the 2004 season.
Period reports even hinted that the PS04B was possibly based more closely on the Arrows A24 than Minardi might have been prepared to publicly admit.
For following season the PS04B was developed into the PS05.
The PS04B was driven by rookie Gianmaria Bruni, and Zsolt Baumgartner who had moved from Jordan. The team managed to earn their first point in two years, after Baumgartner finished 8th (albeit last) at the United States Grand Prix.
In 2005, Minardi used a PS04B chassis for the first three races of the season before they made a new PS05 chassis due to assembly problems.

* Minardi PS04B Technical Specs'Malefiz' (also known as 'Barricade') is a strategy board game, invented by Werner Schöppner and published by Ravensburger since 1960. It is a non-circular descendant of the ancient Indian board game Pachisi.
==Etymology==
The name of the game borrows the obsolete German word 'Malefiz', meaning "misdeed" or "bad action". The word was derived from the Latin word 'maleficus', meaning "mischievous" or "profane".
==Setup==
Malefiz requires the following items:
* 1 gameboard
* 20 pawns (5 in each of 4 player colours)
* 11 barricade pieces
* 1 die
At the outset, each player's pawns are placed in their respective five-space 'houses', typically located along the bottom of the board. Barricade pieces are placed in each of eleven specially marked spaces on the board.
==Gameplay==
First play may be determined by a die-roll or another manner of the players' choosing.
At the beginning of each turn, the active player rolls the die. That player selects one of her five pawns and moves it a number of steps equal to the number shown on the die. That pawn may begin traveling in any direction and may turn to continue through corners in the path, but it may not double-back along its course, and it may not forgo any steps. The spaces within the players' houses are not counted against the die-roll; the first space counted by any pawn is the space immediately above the house.
During the course of a move, a pawn may pass other pawns (regardless of colour) with no effect. In the event that a pawn finishes its move by landing on a space occupied by another pawn, the pawn occupying that space is 'captured'. Captured pawns are returned to their respective houses and become available to rejoin play upon their owner's next turn.
Unlike pawns, barricade pieces may 'not' be passed. In order for play to progress past a barricade, the barricade must be captured by a pawn. A player who captures a barricade must relocate the barrier to an unoccupied space on the board. Barricades may not be placed in the four houses or in any of the 17 spaces in the bottom-most row.
A pawn may not be moved if doing so would cause it either to pass a barricade or to overshoot the uppermost space on the board.
After the move is complete, play passes to the next player.
A player may forgo her move if and only if none of her pawns may be moved.
===Win condition===
The first player to land a pawn in the uppermost space is the winner.

*The 'Arboretum Vilmorin' (4 hectares) is a private arboretum located at 2 rue d'Estienne d'Orves, Verrières-le-Buisson, Essonne, Île-de-France, France. It is open by appointment only. A newer portion of the family arboretum was acquired by the municipality in 1975, and is now open to the public as the Arboretum municipal de Verrières-le-Buisson.
The arboretum is located on the site of a former hunting lodge of Louis XIV of France, acquired in 1815 by Philippe-André de Vilmorin (1776-1862), who also began today's Arboretum national des Barres in 1821. He transformed the lodge's grounds into a collection of trees and shrubs from around the world as missionaries and explorers sent specimens from the Far East, America, North Africa, Siberia, and the Caucasus. Plans for the arboretum walls are attributed to André Le Nôtre.
Today's arboretum has been tended by seven generations of the Vilmorin family, assisted in recent years by a scientific committee. At present the arboretum contains some 2,280 identified species, with major collections of Acer, Berberis, Deutzia, Euonymus, Malus, Lonicera, Philadelphus, Quercus, and Rhododendron. Specimens of interest include 'Carya buckleyi', 'Cedrus libani', 'Chionanthus retusus', 'Halesia diptera', 'Juglans x intermedia', 'Parrotia persica', 'Pinus bungeana', 'Pseudolarix amabilis', 'Quercus persica', 'Sorbus torminalis', 'Taxodium ascendens', and 'Torreya grandis'.

Their breakthrough came following their participation in the MGP jr, a song contest for children organised by Norwegian state broadcaster NRK. Having won MGP jr 2008 with the song 'Oro jaska, beana' ('Be Quiet, Dog') the group went on to represent Norway in the MGP Nordic 2008. They also won this competition after receiving more than half the votes. The band was recently the subject of a legal dispute over the dismissal of two band members, unpaid royalties, and the right to use the band name. However, it was ruled that the band still holds the right to the name, and former band members Alexander Touryguin and Viktoria Eriksen are not owed any money.
==Career==
The group was formed in 2008 by singer Agnete Johnsen, guitarist Emelie Nilsen, bassist Alexander Touryguin, and drummer Viktoria Eriksen. On June 2, 2007, the group participated in Melodi Grand Prix Junior 2008 with their song "Oro, Jaska, Beana." The group won the contest and went on to represent Norway in MGP Nordic 2008. On November 29, 2008, the group won MGP Nordic 2008 after receiving more than half of the votes. "Oro, Jaska, Beana" reached #1 in the Norwegian Singles Charts afterwards. In June 2010, Touryguin and Eriksen were dismissed from the band and were replaced by Nikolaj Gloppen and Simon Stenvoll Pedersen respectively. In 2011, the band participated in Melodi Grand Prix 2011, with their song "Dance Tonight." They ultimately came 2nd place, losing out to the song "Haba Haba" by Stella Mwangi. The band became the subject of a legal dispute over the dismissal of Touryguin and Eriksen, unpaid royalties and the right to use the band name. However, it was recently ruled that the band still holds the right to the name, and Touryguin and Eriksen are not owed any money.

== Trivia ==
In a live chat on the website of Norwegian newspaper 'VG', the group was confronted with the grammatical incorrectness of their name. The group said they were aware that “sheeps” was not the correct plural form but contended that this did not matter. “Many bands have spelling mistakes in their name, such as The Beatles. Remember it’s just a band name, so anything works,” was their reply.

No further edits should be made to this page.The 'Jushi' (), or 'Gushi' (), were a people who established a kingdom during the 1st millennium BC in the Turpan basin (modern Xinjiang, China). The kingdom included the area of Ayding Lake, in the eastern Tian Shan range. During the late 2nd and early 1st century BC, the area was increasingly dominated by the Han Dynasty and the northern neighbours of the Jushi, the Xiongnu, and became one of the many minor states of the Western Regions of Han dynasty China. The Jushi capital (Jiaohe, later known as Yarkhoto, and Yarghul) was destroyed in a Mongol attack in the 13th century.
Contemporary Chinese sources suggest that the Jushi were Caucasoid in appearance. They may have been one of the Tocharian peoples and spoken one of the associated languages.
==Historical accounts==
According to J. P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair, the earliest accounts of the Jushi report them to have "lived in tents, followed the grasses and waters, and had considerable knowledge of agriculture. They owned cattle, horses, camels, sheep and goats. They were proficient with bows and arrows".
Jushi and the kingdom of Krorän were linked in the account of Zhang Qian (d. 113 BC), in part because both were under the control of the Xiongnu.
In or about 60 BC, the Han—ruled at the time by Emperor Xuan—defeated Xiongnu forces at the Battle of Jushi, during the Han–Xiongnu War. Afterwards the main part of the Jushi lands was divided into two states: a southern area controlled by the Han, who referred to it as “Nearer Jushi” (or "Anterior Jushi"), and a northern area known to the Han as “Further Jushi" (or "Posterior Jushi") that was dominated by the Xiongnu. Nearer Jushi was administered by the Han from a capital at Jiaohe (16 kilometres west of the site of modern Turpan). The capital of Further Jushi appears to have been called Yuli or Yulai, and was located about 10 km north of Jimasa, 200 km north of Jiaohe. The Jushi never regained their independence.
==Archaeology==
A 2,700-year-old grave discovered in 2008 at the Yanghai Tombs, an ancient cemetery (54,000 m2 in area), has been attributed to the Jushi or a precursor culture. The grave contains the remains of a shaman who had blue eyes and light-coloured hair.
Near the shaman's head and foot were a large leather basket and wooden bowl filled with 789 grams of dried cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. An international team demonstrated that this material contained tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis. The cannabis was clearly "cultivated for psychoactive purposes," rather than as fibre for clothing or as food. It may have been employed as a medicinal agent, or an aid to divination. This is the oldest known use of cannabis as a pharmacological agent. The extremely dry conditions and alkaline soil acted as preservatives, allowing a team of scientists to carefully analyze the stash, which still looked green though it had lost its distinctive odour.

== Life ==
Affò was born in Busseto in the province of Parma, in the region of Emilia-Romagna. Observing his early inclination for drawing and poetry, Affò's father encouraged him to study in the workshop of the painter and sculptor, Pietro Balestra. After a short time, Affò began pursuing studies in fine arts, demonstrating abilities in the writing.
In his youth, Affò entered the Franciscan order. He continued to pursue his writing, which included poetry. He began to cultivate the study of learning, conducting extensive historical research of Italy and the surrounding area.
Ferdinand, Duke of Parma sent Affò to serve as a professor of philosophy at Guastalla in 1768, where he oversaw the publication of two ancient codices, including Angelo Poliziano's 'Orpheus', and the newly discovered archive of 'the Holy Spirit' in Reggio Emilia. He then edited the critical edition of poetic works of St. Francis of Assisi. His major work in the literary field is still represented by the first five volumes of 'Memoirs of writers and scholars of Parma' (1789 – 1797). While at Guastalla, Affò wrote his 'History of the city and duchy of Guastalla'. He wrote also, 'History of Parma, until 1346', as well as other works connected with the ancient history of Italy. Affò's writing became highly respected throughout Italy.
In 1778, Affò was recalled to Parma to become deputy librarian for the court. In 1785, he became director of the Palatine Library in that city, and later became historiographer of the 'Journal of the Duchy' and honorary Professor of History at the university. While his writing covered a wide variety of subjects, his research was uncannily accurate and valued at the library. In 1792, Affò  began publishing the four volumes of the 'History of Parma'.
He died at the age of 56, in the convent of Busseto, when he contracted typhus fever. He left a manuscript 'History of Peter Louis Farnese'. Girolamo Tiraboschi, an Italian literary critic and historian of Italian literature often quotes his works. His 'Poetical Dictionary' and 'Memoirs', as well as other pieces are inserted in the 'Raccolta Ferrarese di Opuscoli'.

I just blocked JARIAN after another editor noticed that he had been creating some rather subtle hoax articles about a spate of actors, then inserting references to those imaginary actors into other articles.  He sometimes made similar edits while logged-out.  I am concerned that (due to the apparent editing skill of this vandal) he may be using other accounts either to practice or (worse) to further damage Wikipedia.

These articles were typically presented in properly-formatted, internally-wikilinked style.  Some included credible-looking infoboxes, bogus links to IMDb, and Wikipedia categories.  An effort was made to further bolster the credibility of these hoaxes by adding references to these imaginary actors to our other articles.  (A non-exhaustive set of examples: , , , , , , , .)

I endorse this request.  I was alerted to his activity last night via AIV, and while reviewing his contributions discovered that many of the articles he'd created had been flagged for AfD due to being possible hoaxes.  I blocked him for one month since he'd been blocked before for disruption, but TenofAllTrades ramped it up to indef after seeing that he'd engaged in a deliberate effort to bolster the credibility of these hoaxes.  A classic case of gaming the system--the only reason I didn't indef him myself was because the articles just barely escaped G3 territory in my mind.  While the user is now blocked, I agree that a sweep of the IP and any others he used is necessary due to the level of disruption. Blueboy96 18:35, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

'Please do not modify it.'Subsequent requests related to this user should be made 'above', in a new section.The 'Left Party' (', ') is a French democratic socialist political party founded on 1 February 2009. Launched by parliamentarians Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Marc Dolez on 12 November 2008, after their departure from the Socialist Party (PS) following the Congress of Reims, the PG brings together personalities and groups from different political traditions, and claims a socialist, ecologist and republican orientation.
Politically located between the Socialist Party and the French Communist Party, the Left Party intends to federate all the sensitivities of the anti-liberal left ⁠— which he also calls "the other left" ⁠— within the same alliance. In 2008, the PG joined forces with the Communist Party of the United Left and six other left-wing and far-left organizations in the coalition of the Left Front, of which Jean-Luc Mélenchon is the candidate for the presidential election.
The PG was co-chaired from the Le Mans Congress in November 2010, by Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Martine Billard. In April 2016, the Left Party had 8,000 members. At the end of August 2014, Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Martine Billard resigned, and the party leadership was then collectively ensured by the national secretariat.
His weekly newspaper, 'L'Intérêt général' (formerly 'À gauche') is sent to all members but also to simple subscribers. It is printed at more than 15,000 copies a week.
In 2016, in view of the presidential and legislative elections of the following year, Jean-Luc Mélenchon formed a new movement, La France Insoumise, that the Left Party helped to animate.
==History==
People march waving flags during a demonstration against expulsions of foreign students on 5 November 2013 in Toulouse.
It was founded in November 2008 by former Socialist senator Jean-Luc Mélenchon, deputy Marc Dolez, and other dissidents of the party together with the ' movement (', "Movement for a Republican and Social Alternative").
They had left the  five days earlier, in protest of the result of the Reims Congress vote on motions, where the leftist motion they supported won only 19%.
They were joined after by other members from the left of the Socialist Party, by people who hadn't been members of a political party before, and by dissidents from the Green Party following the deputy Martine Billard.
In 2010 the PG was accepted in the Party of European Left.
In November 2013, the  joined the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.
Co-presidents and co-founders Mélenchon and  stepped down from office in 2014. Since its 2015 congress, the party is led by its coordinators and spokespersons Eric Coquerel and Danielle Simonnet.
On 2 July 2018 the party withdrew from the Party of European Left, not agreeing with the presence of the Greek party Syriza in the alliance.
==Elected officials==
* 'Member of the European Parliament:' Jean-Luc Mélenchon
Around 90 local elected officials (municipal, regional and general councillors), including two members of the Council of Paris, initially joined the party. This number has dropped since then.
==Popular support and electoral record==
The PG has not yet run independently in an election, so its base of support is hard to pin-point.

In 1992 Kulikov became Commander of the Interior Troops. Hence he was one of the commanders of pro-government forces during the 1993 Constitutional Crisis in Moscow and the First Chechen War. In early 1995 Kulikov was appointed commander of the Joint Group of Federal Forces in Chechnya and he commanded the Russian forces during the infamous Samashki massacre.
On July 6, 1995, after the Budyonnovsk hostage crisis, he succeeded Viktor Yerin as Interior Minister of Russia. In August 1996 Alexander Lebed, who had just been appointed Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, blamed Kulikov for the disastrous Battle of Grozny and requested that President Boris Yeltsin sack him. However, Yeltsin declined his request and in October fired Lebed from his position. Eventually, Kulikov was dismissed in March 1998 along with the entire second cabinet of Viktor Chernomyrdin.
While most of the ministers of the old cabinet were reappointed to Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet, Kulikov wasn't and Sergei Stepashin became the next interior minister. Afterwards, Kulikov was elected to the State Duma twice, in the 1999 election and 2003 election, and was a member of the pro-government United Russia faction.

==Life and work==
Emmanuel Stupanus was born in Basel, Switzerland. He was the son of Johann Nicolaus Stupanus (1542–1621), Professor of Theoretical Medicine at the University of Basel, and his second wife, Katharina Iselin. He was married to Judith Zörnlin; one of his granddaughters, Judith Stupanus, was to become the wife of Jacob Bernoulli.
Stupanus completed his Gymnasium education in 1603. The next year he was sent to the University of Geneva, where he studied philosophy under Esaïe Colladon and Gaspard Laurent. In 1607 he returned to Basel, having first privately defended the Baccalaureus and later publicly the A.L.M. degree. He continued to study medicine, following the lectures of his father, and Gaspard Bauhin and Felix Plater. After visiting well-known Universities in Germany, France and Italy he was awarded the degree of Medical Doctor from Basel under Petrus Ryff, in 1613.
He also took classes in Ancient Greek from Jacob Zwinger, philosophy from Heinrich Justus, and rhetoric from Friedrich Castellio.
 
From 1614, Stupanus he served privately as a substitute for his father, and after 1617 in an official position. He succeeded his father in the Chair of Theoretical Medicine, in 1620. On March 28, 1620 he delivered his Inaugural Lecture 'De fraudibus Paracelsistarum', in which he expressed his opinion about Paracelsus.  He held this position until his death in 1664, and during this time he served twelve times as Dean of the Medical School, and three times as President of the University. Between the two them, Emmanuel Stupanus and his father occupied the Chair of Theoretical Medicine for a total of 72 years.
Emmanuel Stupanus was the doctoral thesis advisor for several students, among them Franciscus Sylvius in 1637.
Stupanus died on February 26, 1664 in Basel.

*'Márcio-André de Sousa Haz' (born March 2, 1978, Rio de Janeiro) is a Brazilian writer, film director, performer, sound poet and theorist. He signs his books and performs sound poetry under his first name 'Márcio-André' and as a film director uses 'Sousa Haz'.
== Biography ==
'Márcio-André de Sousa Haz' graduated in Literature and has a master's degree in Poetics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. In 2008, he received a scholarship-prize from the Brazilian National Library Foundation and, in 2009, was poet-in-residence in Monsanto, Portugal. He taught an advanced training course in creative writing and sound poetry at University of Coimbra and literary theory at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
In 2007, he appeared in newspaper headlines for his suicide performance in the ghost town of Chernobyl. In his lecture-of-one-man (that he called "Conference Poetic-Radioactive of Pripyat"), Marcio-Andre remained six hours reading his poems between the ruins of the ghost-town Pripyat (Chernobyl), in the so-called Zone of Exclusion, under the deliberate risk of contamination by cesium 137 and strontium 90. After the event, he received the nickname "poeta radioativo" (radioactive poet). This performance resulted in the book Ensaios Radioativos, where he describes the experience of contamination.
==Literature==
Belonging to the so-called "Generation 00" of literature in Brazil, Marcio-Andre is an influential and relevant poet of the younger generation in Brazil and a controversial essayist. With three published books, he was chief-editor of the binational (Brazil / Portugal) Confraria Magazine (ISSN 1808-6276) and founder of Confraria do Vento. Eventually he began to write for Brazilian newspapers such as O Globo, Jornal do Brasil and Estado de Minas. As a translator, he has published texts of Gilles Yvain, Serge Pey, Gherasim Luca, Mathieu Bénézet, Paul Valéry and Hagiwara Sakutaro.
== Performance and sound poetry ==
Multimedia artist, Marcio-Andre has stood out with his research in the area of sound poetry. He held solo performances in several cities in the world, including Paris, London, Lima, Rotterdam, Buenos Aires, Lisbon and São Paulo. Between 2004 and 2007, led the group 'Arranjos para assobio' (Arrangements for whistle) of poetic textures and experimental realities, linked with a sound research project at UFRJ, under academic advising by the philosopher Manuel Antonio de Castro. In 2009, he presented a performance with the American poet Bruce Andrews. In 2009, he has toured to Europe with his work 'Indivisible: polyphonic-poem for voices, violin, electronic processing, bells and whistles'
In his performances, Marcio-Andre uses the computer to processing, live, harmonics sounds and percussive sounds taken from the violin and voice. From this processing, from the creation of electronic textures and from loop recordings, it overlaps sound layers and folds to create a uniform mass of texts and sounds. In his plays are noted influences from noisy music, minimalist music and Eastern music, especially by the use of Tibetan chants and modes of Noh theater. He uses, yet, abstract projections, videodances and video loops projected onto the stage and incorporates various other props in presentations.

The principal of the middle school is Anthony DeRiso and assistant principals Jennifer Wiesman and Vito Mannino. The deans of the middle school are Casey Kornharens and Brian Wipperman. The principal of the high school is Robert Amster and the assistant principals are Jennifer Vitale and Kevin Burgoyne.
== History and organization ==
A kindergarten class' picture, taken in 1959 at the Temple Annex School.
The first Plainedge school was housed in a two-room, wood-frame schoolhouse that became known as the "Annex." It served the district until about 1952 when the John H. West elementary school was built. It was then updated and used as the school district's administration office.
On February 19, 1985, the Plainedge School Union's Board of Education was sued by Carl McCall for a refusal to promote her based on her gender.
The school district is composed of 3 elementary schools, John H. West elementary, Eastplain elementary and Charles E. Schwarting elementary. The middle school is Plainedge Middle School and the high school is Plainedge High School. Former schools include Robert E. Picken elementary, which was sold to the Town of Oyster Bay to serve as a smaller town hall for the southern part of the town; Northedge Elementary (then Kindergarten), which was knocked down to make room for the new Middle School; Baldwin Drive Elementary and Southedge Junior High, which were demolished and the land sold for housing; and Sylvia Packard Middle School, which was shut down after the school, at 40 years of age, was deemed inefficient to serve the continuing needs of the community.
Since Plainedge is not an official town, its students come from parts of Massapequa, North Massapequa, Bethpage, Seaford and Farmingdale.
As a result of school closures caused by the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the Plainedge school district arranged a community effort to turn on stadium and porch lights between 8:20 and 8:40PM on May 1, 2020 to honor the graduating senior class.

==References==The '518th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron' is an inactive United States Air Force unit.  Its last assignment was with Air Defense Command's 408th Fighter Group at Klamath Falls Airport, Oregon, where it was inactivated on 1 July 1959.  The squadron was first activated during World War II as a dive bomber unit, but was disbanded before participating in combat in a general reorganization of Army Air Forces training units.  It was reconstituted during the Cold War as a fighter interceptor unit supporting the air defense of the United States.
==World War II==
A-24 diving
The squadron was activated in April 1943 as the '636th Bombardment Squadron' at Key Field, Mississippi, as one of the original squadrons of the 408th Bombardment Group. In August, along with other Army Air Forces (AAF) single engine dive bomber units, it became a fighter-bomber unit, and was redesignated as the '518th Fighter-Bomber Squadron.' The squadron did not receive aircraft to begin training until October, after it had moved to Drew Field, Florida. It served as an operational training unit with various aircraft, providing cadres to "satellite groups" and as a replacement training unit, training individual pilots.
However, the AAF was finding that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization, were not proving well adapted to the training mission.  Accordingly, it adopted a more functional system in which each AAF base was organized into a separate numbered unit. In this reorganization the squadron was disbanded in 1944 as the AAF converted to the AAF Base Unit system. It was replaced, along with other units at Woodward Army Air Field, by the 267th AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training Station, Fighter) in a reorganization of the AAF in which all units not programmed for deployment overseas were replaced by AAF Base Units to free up manpower for assignment overseas.
==Cold War air defense==
During the Cold War the squadron was reconstituted, redesignated as the '518th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron' and activated at George Air Force Base, California in January 1955, where it was assigned to the 27th Air Division. At George, the squadron flew airborne intercept radar equipped and Mighty Mouse rocket armed North American F-86D Sabre aircraft. The squadron was inactivated and replaced by the 329th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in 1955 as part of Air Defense Command's Project Arrow, which was designed to reestablish the fighter units that had compiled memorable records in the two world wars. The squadron was again active at Klamath Falls Airport, Oregon from 1956 to 1959.

The ghetto was created in 1941, although the first transports of Jews from the German Reich started arriving there as early as 1940. Izbica was the largest transit ghetto in the Lublin reservation, with death rate almost equal to that of the Warsaw ghetto. 'SS-Hauptsturmführer' Kurt Engels, known for his exceptional cruelty, served as its only commandant.
==Ghetto operation==
The Jews who lived in Izbica were kept separate from the new arrivals. They were housed on the other side of the railroad tracks. Also, the Jews shipped in from Germany and Austria were differentiated from Polish Jews by the color of the obligatory star of David signs, yellow for German, and blue for the Polish Jews. In order to make space for the incoming transports, 2,200 local Jews were sent to the Belzec death camp on March 24, 1942. Between March and May 1942, approximately 12,000 to 15,000 new Jews were transported to Izbica from across Europe as part of secretive Operation Reinhard; among them engineers, doctors, economists, army generals and professors from Vienna, Hague, Heidelberg and Breslau, including the vice-president of Prague.  They were housed in a few wooden barracks which could accommodate about half of the prisoners, pressed against each other like sardines. The rest were forced to subsist outdoors. Jews stayed in the barracks usually for no more than four days, with almost nothing to eat. Many victims succumbed to typhus due to poor sanitary conditions in the ghetto. The foreigners, many of whom were proficient in German, had an easier time identifying with their Nazi oppressors than the Polish Jews from inside the ghetto. Denunciations were commonplace.
===Mass killings===
In the early stage of the ghetto existence, the Nazis destroyed the local Jewish cemetery. The tombstones were desecrated and used to build walls of a new prison. The entire ghetto in Izbica was liquidated beginning November 2, 1942, which led to a week of horrific killings at the cemetery. Several thousand Jews (estimated at 4,500) were massacred by the 'Sonderdienst' battalion of Ukrainian Trawnikis in an assembly-line-style, and dumped into hastily dug mass graves. The murders were committed by trained killers who drank heavily, but the soldiers of German Reserve Police Battalion 101 who rounded up the condemned prisoners drank also, especially at night. A second, smaller ghetto was set up in its place for about 1,000 local Jews. It was dismantled on April 28, 1943 with all remaining inmates sent to Sobibor death camp. Of all the Jewish citizens of Izbica (over 90% of its pre-war population), only 14 survived the Holocaust. The Jewish cemetery in Izbica is being reconstructed by the Foundation for the Preservation of Jewish Heritage in Poland.

==Plot==
Danny is an aging hipster in New York City who has fallen on hard times. He does not have a real career, and he has a habit of burning bridges with old friends. His cousin Howard presents him with an opportunity to come to Eastern Europe and help convert an old castle into an alternative resort. Danny has a troubled relationship with Howard. Many years before, when they were children, he cruelly left Howard stranded deep in a cave for days, traumatizing him badly, and ruining much of his childhood.
But Danny is desperate for money, so he decides to work for Howard and travels to the castle, severing his relationships with his New York world. He plunges himself into the strange environment of the castle and puts himself at the mercy of the cousin whom he betrayed many years before. It soon becomes clear that this castle is a deeply strange place with a dark history that is not entirely finished. It has secret passages, bizarre inhabitants, and seems to operate by different rules from the outside world. Danny, cut off from his familiar New York world, is unsure whether the castle is haunted or his own perceptions are becoming increasingly distorted. He thinks that his cousin may be out to get him and that the castle may be a giant trap.
When Danny attempts to escape from the castle, he encounters a series of mysterious roadblocks. No matter what he does, fate seems to be directing Danny back to the castle and towards a final confrontation with his cousin Howard. Together, they end up being trapped deep within the bowels of the castle, where they are forced to re-enact the traumas of childhood. Together, they must figure out a way to escape and survive.

*Hoffert, Barbara.  “Prepub Alert.”  Review of 'The Keep', by Jennifer Egan. 'Library Journal Book Review', April 1, 2006.'Rotterdam Noord' is a railway station in the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, located on the Utrecht–Rotterdam railway. It sits at the border between the two Rotterdam municipalities Noord and Hillegersberg-Schiebroek.
==History==
In 1899, the railway station 'Hillegersberg' was opened on the new connecting line ('Ceintuurbaan') between the railway from Rotterdam Delftsche Poort to Leiden, and the railway from Rotterdam Maasstation to Utrecht. In 1953 the railway from Rotterdam to Utrecht was rerouted to the new Rotterdam Centraal railway station through Hillegersberg. A new station building was constructed, and the station was renamed 'Rotterdam Noord'. Rotterdam Noord is designed by architect Sybold van Ravesteyn who has also designed the stations Rotterdam Centraal, Eindhoven, and many other railway stations and buildings in the Netherlands. The station was opened on 4 October 1953.
==The building==
The platform that leads to Utrecht is connected to a building, where there used to be an NS office that sold tickets. When this office disappeared and the tickets could only be bought at a ticket machine, the building was closed down. Since a few years back the building is used for an art-exposition.
==Train services==
Rotterdam Noord is a station for local trains ('Stoptrein' and 'Sprinter' in Dutch).
The following services currently call at Rotterdam Noord.
*2x per hour local service ('sprinter') Uitgeest - Amsterdam - Woerden - Rotterdam

* Dutch Public Transport journey planner'David de Caires' (31 December 1937 – 1 November 2008) was a Guyanese solicitor. He was also the founder and editor-in-chief of 'Stabroek News'.
De Caires' father Francis was a director of the family company, De Caires Bros Ltd, and a Test cricketer for the West Indies in the 1930s. David attended Stonyhurst College in England.
In the early 60s, de Caires was involved with the New World Group, responsible for publishing 'New World Quarterly' and 'New World Fortnightly' that lasted until 1966. He was a supporter of the The United Force, and a supporter of free-market economics.
Trained as a solicitor, de Caires founded 'Stabroek News' in 1986 with the help of his wife and Ken Gordon of the 'Trinidad and Tobago Express'. After Guyana became independent from Britain in 1971, government policies limited the dissemination of information. The government controlled nearly all aspects of media until President Desmond Hoyte enacted various political changes enabling freedom of speech. de Caires was the first to establish an independent, critical newspaper in the country, and often seen as a watershed moment for media freedom in Guyana. In an interview, de Caires said he was most proud of the Stabroek's letters column section; "We get an enormous sackful of letters every week. We have cultivated this by publishing as many as possible. It is the chance for people to be heard. For such a small paper, we get an enormous volume of letters".
De Caires suffered a heart attack on 14 August 2008. He spent time in hospital in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. He was later transported to a hospital in Barbados, where he died on the morning of 1 November 2008. He is survived by his sisters Mary and Felicity, widow Doreen, son Brendan, and daughter Isabelle, who is married to the former England cricket captain-turned-journalist Michael Atherton.

==References==Phosphatidylcholine, a type of phospholipid in lecithin.
The 'lecithin–sphingomyelin ratio' (a.k.a. L-S or L/S ratio) is a test of fetal amniotic fluid to assess for fetal lung immaturity. Lungs require surfactant, a soap-like substance, to lower the surface pressure of the alveoli in the lungs. This is especially important for premature babies trying to expand their lungs after birth. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids, proteins, and glycoproteins, lecithin and sphingomyelin being two of them. Lecithin makes the surfactant mixture more effective.
==Evaluation==
The lecithin–sphingomyelin ratio is a marker of fetal lung maturity. The outward flow of pulmonary secretions from the fetal lungs into the amniotic fluid maintains the level of lecithin and sphingomyelin equally until 32–33 weeks gestation, when the lecithin concentration begins to increase significantly while sphingomyelin remains nearly the same. As such, if a sample of amniotic fluid has a higher ratio, it indicates that there is more surfactant in the lungs and the baby will have less difficulty breathing at birth. An L–S ratio of 2.4 or more indicates fetal lung maturity and a relatively low risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome, and an L/S ratio of less than 1.5 is associated with a high risk of infant respiratory distress syndrome.
If preterm delivery is necessary (as evaluated by a biophysical profile or other tests) and the L–S ratio is low, the mother may need to receive steroids such as betamethasone to hasten the fetus' surfactant production in the lungs.
==Procedure==
An amniotic fluid sample is collected via amniocentesis and the sample is spun down in a centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 3–5 minutes. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is performed on the supernatant, which separates out the components. Lecithin and sphingomyelin are relatively easy to identify on TLC and the predictive value of the test is good.

* Niche School Review'Long Shadows' is a children's fantasy novel, the fifth book in Erin Hunter's 'Warriors: Power of Three', and was widely released on 25 November 2008. The book follows the adventures of Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, and Jayfeather.
The book has sold over 250,000 copies.
==Plot summary==
When Sol persuades almost all of ShadowClan to give up belief in StarClan, Tawnypelt takes her kits to ThunderClan, hoping to find refuge there, because she did not want to be part of a Clan that does not believe in StarClan. In hope of helping ShadowClan, Jaypaw, along with his siblings and Tawnypelt's kits, create a fake sign from StarClan to show Blackstar that StarClan is real. Blackstar is not convinced until the fake sign turns real when StarClan cats Raggedstar and Runningnose appear, and tell Blackstar to get rid of Sol.
A greencough outbreak begins in ThunderClan, and the Clan is short of the remedy, catmint. Jaypaw has a dream telling him there is a fresh supply in WindClan territory. Jaypaw asks Lionblaze to fetch the catmint. He gets the catmint and gives it to Jaypaw, but not without a tension-filled encounter with his ex-friend Heathertail. Soon the Clan is healed and Jaypaw finally receives his full medicine cat name, Jayfeather.
Later, Jayfeather has a strange dream. In his dream, he has traveled back to a time before the Clans. The lake territories are inhabited by a group of cats who loosely resemble a Clan. Jayfeather awakes as a young cat called Jay's Wing. The cats are being threatened by human expansion, and they hold a vote to move to the mountains. Jayfeather realizes that this group of cats will become the Tribe of Rushing Water, which in turn becomes the modern Clans, so he casts the deciding vote to send the group to the mountains in order to ensure the existence of the future Clans, and he then awakes in the present time again.
 
During a storm, the ThunderClan camp catches fire. Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Squirrelflight are trapped. Squirrelflight makes it through the flames and drags a stick through in an attempt to save her kits. Just as Lionblaze leaps on, Ashfur blocks the way. Squirrelflight begs him to let them through, but Ashfur tells her that he never forgave her for choosing Brambleclaw over him. He says that he will now kill her kits in another attempt to hurt her. Squirrelflight then reveals a crucial secret: they are not her kits, so she will not be hurt if Ashfur kills them. Ashfur lets her kits live, but he threatens to tell her secret.
The fire burns out and the camp is cleaned up. Three days before the Gathering, Ashfur asks Firestar if he can go. Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Squirrelflight are worried that he is going to publicly announce their secret. Between then and the day of the Gathering, the three warn Ashfur that he will regret it if he reveals the secret. He refuses to listen to them. Right before the Gathering, the patrol of warriors going notices that Ashfur is missing. On the way to the Gathering, they see Ashfur's body lying in the WindClan stream as if he had drowned. They take him back to camp and have a vigil for him. However, Leafpool notices a gash in his neck, implying he was murdered. After the Gathering, Firestar announces that Ashfur's death was unknown and suspects a cat from WindClan may have killed him. The three vow to keep the recent events involving them, Squirrelflight, and Ashfur a secret.
==Reception==
'Long Shadows' received mostly positive reviews, praising the tension and characters. 'Horn Book Review' said that' Long Shadows' moves very slowly, but that fans who have read the  previous books would still enjoy it. It received a rating of 4.31 stars on 'Goodreads' and a rating of 4.8 stars on 'Barnes & Noble'.

It was originally titled "Mine", but was first published in 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love' under the title "Popular Mechanics." It was then republished with the title "Little Things" in Carver's 1988 collection 'Where I’m Calling From: New and Selected Stories'.
==Plot summary==
"Little Things" is the story of a couple that has been having relationship issues. Raymond Carver uses ambiguity in the story to describe the situation that is going on between the married couple. Although the problems they are having are not stated specifically, it is clear that the couple is moving apart from each other. The narrator shows us the husband getting ready to leave his wife, which turns into a yelling match. The man is packing a suitcase, getting ready to leave, when he demands to take their child with him. However, the couple then argues about the child as well. The wife holds the child, and they begin to argue about who should take care of the baby. The wife does not want him to have the baby, but the husband thinks he should have it. The couple begins grasping the baby by the arms. The wife has one arm and the husband has hold of the other. Then, the baby begins crying because it is apparently in some pain, due to the actions of the couple. The husband begins forcing his wife’s hands off of the baby, her grip slips off, but she grabs the baby again harder. The wife does the same thing, and the husband grabs the child by the top of his arm underneath the shoulder. The baby was slipping from both people, but they held on harder and pulled in the opposite directions. As the couple pulled on the child from its arms, it is apparent that they harmed the baby in some way, hence the last line of the story:

He won 16 caps for Wales and was selected to play in the British Lions on the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand.
Davies was a short, tough prop forward, who was also known within rugby circles for his cheery demeanor and baritone singing voice.
==Rugby career==
Davies began his rugby career with local club Kenfig Hill before moving to Bridgend. After the war, Davies was persuaded to join first tier club, Cardiff, by Jack Matthews and joined the Blues in the 1945/46 season. Davies made his international debut for Wales during the 1947 Five Nations Championship, when he was selected to face Scotland at Murrayfield. Under the captaincy of Haydn Tanner, Wales beat the Scottish team convincingly and Davies secured his position in the team for the rest of the season. In his second game for Wales, Davies was involved in a memorable match against France at Stade Colombes. In a bruising encounter, Davies bit the ear of French prop Jean Princlary in the scrum, after the Frenchman's continual harassment of Billy Gore, the Welsh hooker. The Welsh team were happy to win the game by a single drop goal.
During the 1947/48 season, Davies was part of one of the strongest Cardiff teams in the club's history. Out of 41 games, Cardiff lost just two, to Pontypool and Penarth, and also beat the touring Australians. Davies was also picked to face the Australians for Wales, which saw the Welsh team win through two penalty goals from Bill Tamplin. Davies played for all four matches of the 1948 Five Nations Championship, though after a draw against England and a win over Scotland, Davies experienced his first international loss when Wales were beaten by both France and Ireland. The 1949 season was a poor one for Davies, as he was picked for only one game of the tournament in another loss to the French.
1950 was a far better year for Davies, which cemented his position as one of the truly great Welsh props. Davies played in all four of the 1950 Championship which saw Wales win their first Grand Slam since 1911. The Welsh pack included two inexperienced players, David Davies and John Robins, and it was Cliff who steadied the Welsh pack, allowing his hooker to win key possession in the scrums. In the opening game against England, Davies also scored his only international points, finishing off a Lewis John run to score a try at Twickenham to give Wales the victory. That year he was chosen for the British Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, and although playing in only one test, he was a popular character who kept up team morale.
Davies' played in the first three opening games of the 1951 Championship, but was dropped after a draw against Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park. Davies then faced his final major touring team, when he was part of the Cardiff team that faced the touring South Africa team. It was a close match which Cardiff lost 11–9. Davies played particularly well in the front row, but when he turned up from working down the mine he was unshaven and used his stubble against the South African prop, Jaap Bekker in the scrum. After rubbing the side of Bekker's face raw, Bekker warned Davies to stop, or he would bite him. Davies did not stop, and Bekker responded by biting a piece out of Davies' ear which caused a heavy bleed.
Davies retired from first class rugby in 1952.

Her novel 'The Mum Hunt' won the Red House Children's Book Award for Younger Readers in 2019, and another, 'My Mum's from Planet Pluto', was nominated for the Carnegie Medal in the same year. Her other popular books for younger children include the 'Fairy Dust' series, the first of which was an Ottakar's Book of the Month choice, and the 'Mermaid Magic' trilogy.
==Biography==
Gwyneth Rees was born in Leicester in 1968. She is half Welsh and half English, and grew up in Scotland after her family moved to Glasgow when she was six.  She studied medicine at Glasgow University, has worked in London as a consultant child psychiatrist, but now writes full-time.  
She wrote her first book when she was ten, inspired by Enid Blyton, but the first to be published was 'Something Secret' in 2001. 
==Books==
Gwyneth Rees writes both books of everyday life and fantasies for younger children, both kinds written with humour and insight. 
In 'My Mum's from Planet Pluto' Daniel faces social disaster when his mother becomes his headteacher, but worse is to come when she starts acting strangely. It is a perceptive tale of the effects of bipolar disorder on a family. In the Esmie series, Esmie tries to find a suitable wife for her widowed policeman father – and then persuade him to get married – as well as solving some mysteries along the way. 'The Making of May' revolves around a garden and another mystery, this time for a girl who lives with her grown-up brother.
The 'Fairy Dust' series has different human characters each time, and the stories are set at different places in the British countryside. The children often have some problem which is helped when they help the fairies – small, winged fairies all, but different in type, tooth fairies in 'Fairy Gold', dream fairies in 'Fairy Dreams', book fairies in 'Fairy Treasure', for example. Fairy dust provides the magic, and believers – both child and adult – can visit fairyland. Rani the mermaid in 'Mermaid Magic' discovers the reason why she is different from the other mermaids and finds her other family. Cosmo, who has always longed to be a witch's cat, discovers that witches can be very bad indeed in 'Cosmo and the Magic Sneeze'.

==References=='Marcellus' (died 366) was an officer of the Roman Empire, supporter of usurper Procopius and usurper himself for a short time.
There are two versions of the history of his usurpation, the first told by Ammianus Marcellinus, a contemporary historian, the second exposed by Zosimus, an historian of the beginning of the 6th century.
== Ammianus Marcellinus' version ==
Ammianus Marcellinus underlines the fact that Marcellus was a relative of Procopius (a member of the Constantinian dynasty). In 365 Procopius rebelled against emperor Valens, taking the purple; Marcellus became his 'protector' and was entrusted with the defence of Nicaea. When, in 366, Procopius was killed, Marcellus killed Serenianus, a cruel general of Valens' who had been captured by Procopius at Cyzicus, and then conquered Chalcedon.
Procopius had based his usurpation on his bond with the Constantinian dynasty and on the support of some barbaric peoples; Marcellus tried to exploit his own bond to Procopius and to consolidate an alliance with Gothic tribes. He proclaimed himself emperor, but his rule was short. Valens' 'magister militum', Equitius, came to know about Procopius' death and attacked Marcellus, capturing him. After a few days, Marcellus and some of his supporters were put to death.
== Zosimus' version ==
According to Zosimus, Marcellus was sent by Procopius from Constantinople into Bithynia, to counter the cavalry unit under Serenianus' command and loyal to Valens. Serenianus occupied Cyzicus, but Marcellus put the city under siege and took it, forcing Serenianus to flee; after a short pursuit in Lydia, Marcellus killed him.
After Procopius' death, Valens captured Marcellus. According to Zosimus and John of Antioch, Marcellus was suspected of planning a usurpation, as he had been found with the regalia of Procopius; thus Valens ordered his death and that of his family and his supporters.

Comiskey was the daughter-in-law of Charles Comiskey and inherited control of the White Sox upon the death of her husband, J. Louis Comiskey.
==Early life==
Comiskey was born on May 15, 1893, in Chicago to parents Thomas and Elizabeth Reidy alongside two other siblings. She was educated at Adelphi College.
In 1912, when she was invited to attend Chicago White Sox baseball game between the Chicago Cubs, Comiskey met her future-husband J. Louis Comiskey. She married Comiskey in September 1913 and they spent their honeymoon following the Chicago White Sox and New York Giants World Tour co-ordinated by her father-in-law Charles Comiskey.
==Career and death==
Upon the death her husband in 1939, Comiskey inherited control of the White Sox of the American League from  through . Prior to gaining control, she entered into a legal battle with the First National Bank of Chicago who wished to sell the Comiskey's stock in the team to make up for lost earning. Eventually, Judge John F. O'Connell denied the banks' right to solicit bids for sale or stock in the White Sox. In 1941, Comiskey petitioned the Court to release her dowry rights, which would have been held as part of the estate until her youngest son reached 21, in order to purchase more stock. Once she was awarded the $60, 000, she bought 1, 000 shares in the White Sox to re-assume majority.
On March 4, 1941, Comiskey was formally elected president of the White Sox by the team's board of directors, becoming the first woman president of an American League baseball team. When speaking about her milestone achievement, Comiskey said: “I believe a woman can fulfill the duties capably.” During her tenure with the White Sox, Comiskey was described as an "uncompromising, dowager who ruled the baseball club –and her family– with a velvet fist." This caused conflict between her and her son Charles, who quit the organization after Comiskey reneged on her promise of a raise. By her fifth year as president, she increased home attendance by 10% and retained Jimmy Dykes until 1946.
Comiskey died of a heart attack in 1956 and control of the White Sox passed to Comiskey's eldest daughter, Dorothy Comiskey Rigney.

*'Chile–Estonia relations' are foreign relations between Chile and Estonia. Chile re-recognized Estonia on August 28, 1991 and diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on September 27, 1991. Chile is represented in Estonia through its ambassador who resides in Helsinki (Finland) and through an honorary consulate in Tallinn.  Estonia is represented in Chile through an honorary consulate in Santiago. The current Chilean ambassador to Estonia, Carlos Parra Merino, officially presented his credentials to the Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves in June 2007. Carlos Parra Merino resides in Helsinki.
== Treaties ==
*An agreement on visa-free travel between Estonia and Chile came into force on 2 December 2000.
*The two countries also have in force a Memorandum on co-operation between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs.
== Trade ==
Chile is among Estonia's most important foreign trade partners in South America. In 2007, trade between Estonia and Chile was valued at 6.3 million EUR.  Estonian exports included mainly machinery, mechanical equipment, and mineral fuels; Chile exports included mainly wine, fish, crustaceans and fruit.  In 2004, 83% of Chile exports to Estonia, then totaling 2.4 million EUR, consisted of wine.  In 2008, Chilean wines held the highest share of Estonia's imported wine market, followed by Spanish wines.  Due to its climate being unsuitable for large-scale grape production, most wine sold in Estonia is imported.
== Culture ==
In 2006, Estonia and Chile issued the joint Antarctic themed stamp series, designed by Ülle Marks and Jüri Kass, bearing images of the Emperor penguin and the minke whale. The works of Chilean writers Isabel Allende, Pablo Neruda and José Donoso have been translated into Estonian.

The organization traces its roots to the days of interactive laser disc production in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 1980s. Originally the society was proposed as a special interest group of the International Television Association (ITVA), now known as Media Communications Association – International (MCA-I), but the charter members decided to establish the society as an independent entity with different membership requirements for the new interactive and computer based communications. The charter members were composed of equipment vendors, independent producers, training professionals and members of Apple's IIe computer group, Sony's SMC-70 computer & interactive LaserDisc groups and Pioneer's interactive Laserdisc groups.
In its heyday the organization had hundreds of members in the San Francisco Bay Area and thousands of members worldwide with chapters in Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, San Diego, Detroit (Great Lakes).

==References=='Estonia–Spain relations' are the bilateral and diplomatic relations between these two countries. Estonia maintains one embassy in Madrid and two honorary consulates in the cities of Barcelona and Seville, while Spain has an embassy and an honorary consulate in Tallinn.
In 2007 the number of Spaniards residing in Estonia stood at 54 people, while the number of non-resident Spaniards was 55.
== History ==
International relations between Spain and Estonia began in 1921, when Spain recognized the independence of the Republic of Estonia. On 24 August 1991 Spain once again recognized Estonia's independence from Soviet Union. Both countries established diplomatic relations on 10 September of the same year. On 3 December 1992 Spain established an Honorary Consular Office in Tallinn under the Spanish embassy of Helsinki, it was not until 2004 when it opened its own embassy in the capital Estonia. The first ambassador of Spain in Estonia was Miguel Bauzá y More, who held the position until 11 January 2008 when he was replaced by Eduardo Ibáñez López-Dóriga. For its part Estonia opened an embassy in Madrid in 1997, between 2000 and 2007 the ambassador was Andres Tomasberg, since 2007 the position is held by Andres Rundu. Currently, the relations between the two countries are framed within the scope of the European Union, highlighting the fact that the two countries are part of the external borders of the Union.
== Economic relations ==
Exchanges between Estonia and Spain have maintained an upward pace with a positive balance in favor of Spain which, in 2007, sold products to Estonia for a total of 120 million euro s while importing for a total of 54 million . The main imports from Estonia are composed of fuel and mineral oils, wood, charcoal, manufacturing sy steel and iron from smelting waste. While Spain's main exports are made up of automobiles, tractor is, ceramic products and edible fruits. 
On the other hand, the investments between both countries have reached a more even level, since although in 2006 Estonia only invested 6,100 euros in Spain the following year it did so for a value of 1,984,420 euros. In contrast, Spain in 2006 invested 1,022,170 euros while in 2007, it was reduced to 283,230.
At the end of 2008 the Estonian Hispanic Chamber of Commerce was established with headquarters in Tallinn.
=== Tourism ===
The number of Spanish tourists traveling to Estonia has been increasing every year, in 2006 were 15,150 who spent the night at least one night in the country. However, most tourists visiting Estonia do so through cruise ships or from Helsinki on a round trip on the same day, so it is estimated that the number of Spanish visitors is much higher.
Estonia is present at the tourism fairs in Barcelona, EIBTM (since 2004) and Madrid, FITUR (since 2005). In addition, the airline Estonian Air has since 2006 a regular line between Tallinn and Barcelona.
== Cultural relations ==
Since 1996, Spanish studies can be taken at Tartu University, the most prestigious in the country. The University of Tallinn introduced this possibility in 2001 and since 2003 this university has an examination center of the Instituto Cervantes. 
== Agreements ==
Estonia and Spain have signed the following agreements: in 1997 the Agreement on international road transport; in 1998 the Agreement for the Protection of Investments; in 1999 the Protocol of cooperation between the Ministries of Defense; in 2000 the Agreement on the reciprocal abolition of visas, the Agreement for the readmission of persons and the Agreement for the extradition of criminals; in 2005 the Agreement to avoid double taxation; and in 2007 the Agreement for the protection of classified information and the Agreement for cooperation in culture and education.

== References =='Riccardo Taddei' (born 5 September 1980, in Vecchiano) is an Italian football manager and former player, who played as a forward. He is currently serving as the assistant manager of Pisa, under head coach Luca D'Angelo.
== Playing career ==
Taddei started his career at Pontedera, a club based in the Province of Pisa. He was then signed by AC Fiorentina as back-up for forwards Nuno Gomes, Enrico Chiesa, Gabriel Batistuta, and Leandro Amaral. He made his Serie A debut on 6 November 1999 against Cagliari Calcio, collecting five league appearances during his three seasons with the team. He also played once in the 2001–02 UEFA Cup.
After the relegation and bankruptcy of Fiorentina, in 2002, he was signed by Genoa of Serie B on a free transfer. He failed to gain regular playing time with the team, however, and subsequently joined Cremonese of Serie C2, with whom won promotion to Serie C1 as the runner-up of Group A in 2003–04. During the 2004–05 season, he won promotion again, this time as the champion of Serie C1 Group A. During the 2005–06 season, however, he did not play any games for the club in Serie B. After Cremonese were relegated at the end of the season, he played seven more times for the team during the 2006–07 Serie C1 season. In August 2007, he moved to Brescia of Serie B.
After only making three appearances for Brescia in the Italian top flight during the first half of the 2010–11 season, in January 2011, he joined U.S. Triestina Calcio.
In July 2011 he joined A.S. Casale Calcio.
The following season he moved to Rimini. In the summer of 2013 he signed a two-year contract with Alessandria. He ended his career with Catanzaro, after becoming a free agent at the conclusion of the 2015–16 season.
== Managerial career ==
For the 2016–17 season, Taddei joined the coaching staff of Bassano Virtus manager Luca D'Angelo, in the role of assistant coach. After D'Angelo's dismissal in 2017, he left the club, and retained his post as the former's assistant manager at Casertana, and subsequently Pisa in 2018; with the latter side, they obtained promotion to Serie B during the 2018–19 season.
== Style of play ==
A creative left–footed forward or midfielder, with excellent technical skills, Taddei usually played as a second striker or as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing as a left winger. Despite the talent that he displayed in his youth, his career was affected by several injuries, which impeded him from establishing himself at the top level.

Until the second half of 2014 the access to web pages of the 'Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online' was through identification numbers. The site no longer uses this method but instead locates the page under the name of the individual with the volume number. So the article on Richard Willis Jameson is now located at http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/jameson_richard_willis_12E.html How to use the legacy parameters is described below in the collapse box and access via that method is still supported by the DCB website (presumably to support legacy links). 
The ID parameter is derived from the "id_nbr" parameter of the articles URL.
For example, if the biography item for Richard Willis Jameson is located at this URL:
 http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr='6182'
Then the ID parameter in this case is '6182'.

'Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este' () (14 July 1817, Modena, Duchy of Modena and Reggio – 25 March 1886, Gorizia, Austria-Hungary) was a member of the House of Austria-Este and Archduchess of Austria, Princess of Hungary, Bohemia, and Modena by birth. Henri was disputedly King of France and Navarre from 2 to 9 August 1830 and afterwards the Legitimist pretender to the throne of France from 1844 to 1883. Maria Theresa was the eldest child of Francis IV, Duke of Modena and his niece-wife Maria Beatrice of Savoy.
==Life==
Maria Theresa married Henri, comte de Chambord, the posthumous son of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, younger son of Charles X of France, by his wife, Princess Caroline Ferdinande of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies, by proxy on 7 November 1846 in Modena and in person on 16 November 1846 in Bruck an der Mur. Maria Theresa and Henri produced no children.
Maria Theresa had been chosen as Henri's wife by his paternal aunt Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte of France. Marie-Thérèse sought to ally the exiled French Royal Family with the House of Austria-Este for several reasons: it was Roman Catholic and the only royal family not to have recognized the July Monarchy of Louis-Philippe of France. Henri had actually preferred Maria Theresa's youngest sister, Maria Beatrix.
After Henri's death on 24 August 1883, Maria Theresa and a minority of Henri's supporters held that Juan, Count of Montizón, as senior male descendant of Louis XIV, was his successor. Juan's wife was Maria Theresa's sister, Maria Beatrix.
Maria Theresa was instrumental in building a crypt for the French Royal Family at the Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady on Castagnevizza in Görz (now in Nova Gorica, Slovenia). It was her wish that the last of the Bourbons be gathered in one place together within the monastery at Castagnevizza. Three years after the death of her husband Henri, Maria Theresa died on 25 March 1886 in Görz, then Austria and was interred with her husband in the crypt of the church of Franciscan Monastery of Castagnevizza in Görz, then Austria, now Kostanjevica in the Slovenian town of Nova Gorica.

;HISTORY OF CORPORATE FINANCING'Hungary–Spain relations' are the bilateral relations between Hungary and the Kingdom of Spain. Both nations are members of the Council of Europe, European Union, NATO, OECD and the United Nations.
==History==
Historically, Hungary (as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and Spain were both ruled by the House of Habsburg for a few centuries. As such, both empires were allies in several wars such as the Thirty Years' War and the Ottoman–Habsburg wars. In October 1918, the Kingdom of Hungary became independent after the Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.
During the Spanish Civil War, over 1,000 Hungarian volunteers fought for the Republican faction. The Hungarian volunteers had their own battalion known as the 'Rakosi Battalion'. In February 1938 Hungary, led by Miklós Horthy, officially recognized the government of Francisco Franco. 
In 1945, soon after the end World War II, Spain broke diplomatic relations with Hungary after that nation became a communist country. In January 1977, both nations re-established diplomatic relations.
Bilateral relations between Hungary and Spain are good on a political level. There is no known dispute between the two countries. In 2017, both nations celebrated 40 years of diplomatic relations.
==Bilateral agreements==
Embassy of Spain in Budapest
Both nations have signed several bilateral agreements such as a Judicial Settlement and Arbitration Treaty (1929); Air Transport Agreement (1974); Agreement on Commercial Exchanges, Navigation, Transport and the Development of Economic, Industrial and Technical Cooperation (1976); Agreement for Scientific and Technical Cooperation (1979); Cultural and Scientific Cooperation Agreement (1982); Tourism Cooperation Agreement (1982); Consular Agreement (1982); Agreement to Avoid Double Taxation and Prevent Tax Evasion in matters of Income and Wealth Taxes (1984); Agreement on Reciprocal Enforcement of Judicial Resolutions in criminal matters (1987); Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Certificates and Academic Titles (1989); Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (1989); and a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation (1992).

== References ==The 'Lebanese Air Force Aviation School' ( 'Madrasat al-Kouwat al-Jawiya') is a military school and part of the Lebanese Air Force, established in 1960. The school aims to qualify air force pilots, and is located at Rayak Air Base; however it is controlled by the air force command in Beirut Air Base. The school currently employs Robinson Raven R44 II helicopters of the Fifteenth Squadron for these training purposes.
==Mission==
The school trains the air force pilots according to the needs of the trainees and according to the school's capabilities, taking into consideration the ongoing technological and military advancements. It also helps the army officers, who were transferred from the military academy for this purpose, by technically preparing them to fly jet planes and helicopters and giving them courses in air and ground tactics. The school gives other minor courses including foreign language courses in order to keep a high educational standard between their trainees. Pilots are always trained by the school, in compliance with the missions given forth by the colleges and schools of the Lebanese army.
==History==
August 1, 1982 was the date in which the last air force officers were promoted from the school. During the Lebanese Civil War training was stopped, however after 4 years the trainees were sent for training programs abroad. In 1995, and after the army's new UH-1H helicopters supplied by United States, the trainees were transferred back to the school. Training activities resumed in 1997, and officers shifting in major were directed from the ground forces to the air force. Training in the school's original base was halted in that period until November 5, 2001, when 6 new officers were transferred to the air force in addition to 4 observing officers (promoted in 2003). In 2002, 3 officers also joined the school for a 2-years training period.
Prior to using the Robinson Raven R44 II starting 2005, the school used to train ab-initio on the UH-1 Iroquois helicopters; However, the Huey is still used later in the course during the advanced Helicopter Training.
==Program==
* Ground School, which includes courses in Aerodynamics, aerial monitoring, introduction to the aircraft and sign communication with the watch tower. At the end of the first training sessions, the trainees take a test in order to see their progress. This test comes after a period of 15 hours of preliminary training.
* Second year, which encompasses general aviation and military courses in addition to several levels required to be passed:
** Solo, the first level training period where the newly trained pilot takes a 30-minute aviation test.
** Emergence Phase, a training period inside the periphery of the air base.
** Combined Area, a training period outside the base's periphery.
* Third year, which includes training on a simulator, mountainous and low training, in addition to aviation, tactical and night aviation. This period ends by taking operational training and then the pilot joins specified groups after having passed a total period of 180 aerial flights.
===Simulators===
The Lebanese Air Force is interested in obtaining one UH-1 flight simulator, with training and logistical support. This requires upgrading the facilities of the school also.
==Achievements==
In addition to the training courses given to the pilots, a training program was established for a period of 3 months. This program, which has been taken by 3 officers, teaches trainees to fly on newly  supplied aircraft that undergo maintenance to test its endurance.

=== Campaign ===
McGovern was one of several liberal Democratic U.S. senators targeted for defeat in 1980 by the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC), which put out a year's worth of negative portrayals of McGovern.  They and other pro-life groups especially focused on McGovern's support for pro-choice abortion laws.  McGovern faced a Democratic primary challenge for the first time, from a pro-life candidate. 
Abdnor, a four-term incumbent congressman who held identical positions to McGovern on farm issues, was solidly conservative on national issues, and was well liked within the state.  Abdnor's campaign focused on both McGovern's liberal voting record and what it said was McGovern's lack of involvement in South Dakotan affairs.  McGovern made an issue of NCPAC's outside involvement, and that group eventually withdrew from the campaign after Abdnor denounced a letter they had sent out.  Far behind in the polls earlier, McGovern outspent Abdnor 2-to-1, hammered away at Abdnor's refusal to debate him (drawing attention to a slight speech defect Abdnor had), and, showing the comeback pattern of some of his past races in the state, closed the gap for a while. 
However, McGovern was solidly defeated in the general election, receiving only 39 percent of the vote to Abdnor's 58 percent.  McGovern became one of many Democratic casualties in that year's Republican sweep, which became known as the "Reagan Revolution". McGovern was one of nine incumbent Senators to lose a general election that year, and his margin of defeat was by far the largest until Doug Jones was defeated by Tommy Tuberville in 2020.

==References==Cardiff Bay Retail Park sign
The 'Cardiff Bay Retail Park' in Grangetown, Cardiff was once the site of the Ferry Road landfill site. It was built in around 1997. It is currently home to businesses which include Asda, Boots and Argos.
==Development==
The retail park is built on the edge of a former Ferry Road refuse site, which closed in 1994 after being filled with 4 million cubic metres of commercial and domestic rubbish. The ownership of the land passed to Cardiff Bay Development Corporation who created the retail park on an area of industrial units to the east of the site. Grangemoor Park was created opposite the retail park on the 20 metre hill landscaped on the old refuse site.

'Sir Arthur Paget' GCB, PC (15 January 1771 – 26 July 1840) was a British diplomat and politician.
==Family and early life==
Arthur Paget was the third son of Henry Paget, 1st Earl of Uxbridge and his wife Jane Champagné daughter of Arthur Champagné, Dean of Clonmacnoise in Ireland. He was a younger brother of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey.  
He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford, but did not take a degree.
== Diplomatic career ==
In 1791, he entered the British diplomatic service.  In 1794, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Anglesey.  He nominally represented this for 13 years, though usually abroad.  In 1794, he was sent as Envoy-extraordinary to Berlin to remind King Frederick William II of his obligations, a service in which Lord Malmesbury the ambassador commended him for his tact.
His next appointment was as Envoy Extraordinary to the Elector Palatine and the Perpetual Diet at Regensburg in 1798, followed by Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary first at Naples in 1800 and then at Vienna the following year.  He remained at Vienna until 1806, being nicknamed "The Emperor" on account of his extravagance.
A dispatch in 1802, following Napoleon's creation of the Confederation of the Rhine predicted the hegemony of Prussia within Germany.  He was materially responsible for the creation of the Third Coalition, and reported its collapse following the Battle of Austerlitz  (2 December 1805), a dispatch that is said to have hastened the death of William Pitt the Younger (23 January 1806).
After his recall from Austria, he was sent to the Ottoman Porte in 1807, where he told the Sultan of a secret clause in the Treaty of Tilsit adverse to his interests.  However, he was unable to detach the Ottoman Empire from its French Alliance.  He was recalled in 1809 and awarded a pension of £2000.
== Retirement ==
Paget had been made a Privy Councillor and Knight of the Bath, both in 1804, and was given a GCB in 1815.  In 1808, he eloped with Lady Augusta Fane, then the wife of Lord Boringdon, and married her the following year, as soon as her divorce took place.  They had several children, including Sir Augustus Berkeley Paget, who followed his father as a diplomat.  He occupied time in his retirement as an agriculturalist and yachtsman.

;Notes'Jens Lauritz Arup Seip' (11 October 1905 – 5 September 1992) was a Norwegian historian originally trained as a medieval historian, but stood out as the strongest of his time in interpreting Norwegian political history in the 1800s, particularly known for having created the term "embedsmannsstaten". He was a professor at the University of Oslo from 1952 to 1975, he specialized in political history and the history of ideas. He was married to fellow historian Anne-Lise Seip. Seip's use of the Norwegian language and his writing style which numerous historians have described as brilliant, and often tried emulating. Seip was included among the 16 authors of " The Norwegian literary canon" from 1900 to 1960  and 2nd among 20 authors in a ranking of nonfiction writers conducted by Dagbladet in 2008. Seip received an honorary doctorate at the University of Bergen from 1975.
==Personal life==
Jens Arup Seip was born in Bolsøy, near Molde. He was a descendant of military officer and politician Andreas Martin Seip (1790–1850). Andreas' grandson Jens Laurits Arup Seip, brother of politician Karl Seip, was the father of academic Didrik Arup Seip and politician Hans Kristian Seip, the latter being the father of Jens Arup Seip. Jens Arup Seip was also a first cousin of the forester and state secretary Hans Kristian Seip, and a second cousin of politician Helge Seip and physician Martin Fredrik Seip, who were grandnephews of Jens' grandfather Jens Laurits.
Jens Arup Seip was married to teacher and painter Rachel Lehre Seip (1931–1960) and had three children, Hans Christian, Morten and Knut, then to historian Anne-Lise Seip, whom he met while she was a student at the University of Oslo. The couple lived at Høvik in Bærum, and had two children, Ingebjørg and Åsmund, both of whom are academics. He died in September 1992 in Bærum.
==Career==
He graduated as cand.philol. in 1931. He worked as a research fellow at the University of Oslo from 1936, under the tutorship of Edvard Bull, and became known for the journal article 'Problemer og metode i norsk middelalderforskning' in 1940. He then worked for the National Archival Services of Norway from 1941. The same year his uncle Didrik Arup Seip was removed by the Nazi occupants from his position as rector. Jens Arup Seip completed his thesis 'Sættargjerden i Tunsberg og kirkens jurisdiksjon' in 1942, but did not receive the dr.philos. degree until 1945. He worked as a lecturer in history from 1946, and was also a consultant at the Norwegian Nobel Institute from 1946 to 1958. From 1955 to 1966 he chaired the Norwegian Historical Association.
In 1952 he was promoted to the position of professor. In addition, he drifted from his former specialty in medieval history to political history and the history of ideas. Among his most important publications were 'Fra embedsmannsstat til ettpartistat' (1963) and 'Utsikt over Norges historie' in two volumes (1974 and 1981). He retired from the position as professor in 1975, incidentally the same year that his wife was appointed to the Institute of History. Many of his terms have entered the Norwegian historio-political lexicon.

It dates mainly from the 13th century and contains many Byzantine churches in the area and Ottoman mosques. It is built on a rocky hill on the left bank of the river Osum and is accessible only from the south. It is situated at an elevation of .
==History==
Monogram of Michael on the walls of the castle
After being burned down by the Romans in 200 B.C., the walls were strengthened in the 5th century under Roman Emperor Theodosius II to protect from Barbarian incursions into the Balkans. They were subsequently rebuilt during the 6th century under the Emperor Justinian I and again in the 13th century under the Despot of Epirus, Michael I Komnenos Doukas, cousin of the Byzantine Emperor. This last phase can be seen as a Monogram formed by red bricks set in a wall of the castle. The castle was under the rule of John Komnenos Asen in the mid-14th century The main entrance, on the north side, is defended by a fortified courtyard and there are three smaller entrances.
The fortress of Berat in its present state, even though considerably damaged, remains a magnificent sight. The surface that it encompasses made it possible to house a considerable portion of the cities inhabitants. The buildings inside the fortress were built during the 13th century and because of their characteristic architecture are preserved as cultural monuments. The population of the fortress was Christian, and it had about 20 churches (most built during the 13th century) and only one mosque, for the use of the Turkish garrison (of which there survives only a few ruins and the base of the minaret). The churches of the fortress were damaged through years and only some have remained.
Berat Castle is depicted on the reverse of the Albanian 10 lekë coin, issued in 1996, 2000 and 2013.

'Borsh Castle' () also known as 'Sopot Castle' () from the hill it is located, is a ruined castle near the village Borsh, Albania, near the coast of the Ionian Sea. Inside the castle is the 17th-century Hajji Bendo Mosque from Ottoman times.
== History ==
The castle dates to Antiquity, and its fortifications follow the trace of an acropolis, with four subsequent phases of reconstruction, ranging from the early Byzantine period to the late Middle Ages. The name "Sopot" is of Slavic origin. In medieval Greek documents, the castle is named 'Sopoton' or 'Sopotos', from which its name in other languages derives; its harbour is mentioned in Greek portolans with the name 'Gazopolis'. 
The site is first mentioned in the early 13th century, when archbishop Demetrios Chomatenos wrote of the "archonship of 'Sopotos'" (, 'archontia Sopotou'), part of the region of Vagenetia. In 1258, the Despot of Epirus Michael II Komnenos Doukas gave the castle along with Buthrotum and the island of Corfu as dowry for his daughter Helena to Manfred, King of Sicily. It came back under Epirote control soon thereafter, before being once again ceded by Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas to Charles I of Anjou in 1279. The area returned again to Epirote hands in the subsequent decades, but in the Epirote rebellion against Palaiologan Byzantine rule in 1338–39, it remained loyal to Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. 
Following the Ottoman conquest, a cadaster from 1431 lists 'Sopot' with 60 households, and as capital of a 'nahiye'. In 1456, troops of King Alfonso V of Aragon were operating in the area of 'Sobato' against the Ottomans. In 1470 it was under Venetian control, under the jurisdiction of the governor of Corfu; at the end of the Ottoman–Venetian War of 1463–1479, the Ottomans laid claim to it and apparently received it, for in 1488 the local Albanian population rebelled against Ottoman rule. 
The walls of the castle, which follow the ancient fortifications, survive. In the interior, the medieval fortress was divided through a wall in two. Triangular towers were added later, probably during the middle Byzantine period. In the interior of the castle stand ruins of various buildings and cisterns.

*The 'history of the Jews in Mumbai' (previously known as 'Bombay'), India, began when Jews started settling in Bombay during the 18th century, due to its economic opportunities. The Jewish community of Bombay consisted of the remnants of three distinct communities: the Bene Israeli Jews of Konkan, the Baghdadi Jews of Iraq, and the Cochin Jews of Malabar.
Bombay is home to the majority of India's rapidly dwindling Jewish population. At its peak, in the late 1940s, the Jewish population of Bombay reached nearly 30,000.
==Arrival in Bombay==
The first Baghdadi Jew, Joseph Semah, moved to Bombay from Surat in 1730 and the first member of the Bene Israel community to move from the Konkan villages south of Bombay to the city arrived in 1746 part of the Divekar family. In 1796 Samuel Ezekiel Divekar (1730-1797) established "The Gate of Mercy" synagogue.
==Present population==
Less than 4,000 Jews live in Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, and there are 
eight synagogues in the city. Today, the majority of Mumbai's Jews reside in Israel.
==Activities==
The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee runs a Jewish Community Center and has 500 members with classes on Hebrew and Judaism, holiday parties, youth discos and clubs for children and seniors. Also, there is an "ORT" (Organization for educational Resources and Technological training), an international Jewish organization with the mandate of helping impoverished Jews and which sells kosher wine, challah, chicken and baked goods.
Also, started in 2004 is the Hazon Eli Foundation for Jewish Life in India, based in Thane (a suburb of Mumbai where many younger Jewish families are moving to), to teach Torah, Hebrew and Jewish law to the suburban population. A Sunday school is run there for children under 13, which attracts about 25 students weekly.
In Mumbai, there is also the Jewish founded "Sir Jacob Sassoon High School" and "Sir Elly Kadoorie High School".  Today there are only a handful of Jewish students left, but they once had Hebrew and Torah classes.
==Terrorist attacks on Mumbai==
Until the terrorist attacks on Mumbai of November 2008, the Mumbai Chabad House Jewish outreach center was at Nariman House, Hormusji Street. In the attack, six Jews were held hostage and murdered at the center, the 29-year-old Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, his 28-year-old wife, Rivka, Rabbi Aryeh Leibish Teitelbaum (37), Bentzion Chroman (28), Yocheved Orpaz (62) and Norma Shvarzblat-Rabinovich (50). The parents of Rivka Holtzberg have announced their intention to continue Chabad's emissary work in Mumbai, although the Chabad House may move to a new location in the city mostly in South Mumbai near Worli. 
==Communal relations==
Mumbai Jews' ties with their city's Muslim community have historically been strong and remain so even after the Mumbai attacks. The two groups have been drawn together as minorities in a Hindu-dominated land – even by the similarities of their non-vegetarian diets of Kosher and Halal foods. "For these reasons, most Bene synagogues in Mumbai are in Muslim areas," Jonathan Solomon, chairman of the Indian Jewish Federation, said. Mumbai's Muslim Council had ordered that the nine gunmen killed should not be buried in the city, a gesture which was highly appreciated by the Mumbai Jewish community.

*  Mumbai Jews The Movie 2016"'Mary Ann'" was the British entry in the 'Eurovision Song Contest 1979', performed in English by Black Lace.
The song is about a man who is estranged from his girlfriend Mary Ann after her friend caught him with another woman, and is desperate to be reconciled with her.
==At Eurovision==
The song was performed 17th on the night, following Norway's Anita Skorgan with "Oliver" and preceding Austria's Christina Simon with "Heute in Jerusalem". Despite taking the lead after Denmark had awarded the song 10 points, at the close of voting, it had received 73 points, placing it seventh in a field of 19. Norway also awarded the song 10 points, the highest marks received.
It was succeeded as British representative at the 1980 Contest by Prima Donna with "Love Enough for Two".
==Charts==
The single reached No.42 in the UK charts, the lowest placing for a Eurovision entrant in several years, although Black Lace would later go on to greater chart success in the United Kingdom in the 1980s with singles such as "Agadoo".

== How it happened ==
After seeing a promotional video the band had made for agents in a bid to get more work around the country, songwriter Peter Morris approached Black Lace with a view to recording his song 'Mary Ann'. He wanted the group to sound like chart-topping band Smokie.
As the song "required" a ‘throaty’ vocal line, it was decided that Alan would take the lead vocal. This was a controversial decision at the time: Alan had not sung lead before and Steve, the band's lead singer, felt that his position within the band was being threatened.
The band travelled to London to record a rough demo of the song at ATV's studio, which was then sent to EMI Records. EMI had booked Berwick Street Studios in Soho  for  a twelve-hour day with engineer Gwyn Mathias, to record songs by  six artistes. Each artiste was allotted 2 hours to record and mix their record.  Black Lace was one of the six acts. Amongst the others were The Swinging Blue Jeans. The record company liked the result, and within a few weeks the band returned to London and signed a recording contract. That second recording  session was released by EMI as the single. it took just two hours  to record their first official single 'Mary Ann'. A day was booked at Berwick Street a couple of weeks later to record the B side -'Drivin'- written by Barton/Routh.
However, there was a problem: Smokie’s publishers, RAK Music, insisted that 'Mary Ann' was a rip-off of Smokie’s song "Oh Carol" and threatened to take legal action. The song's publishing company, ATV Music, insisted that any similarity was purely coincidental, and since they showed that the notation of the two songs were different the case was dropped.
However, it was no secret in the Black Lace camp that everything possible was done to sound like Smokie, from the lead vocal to the harmonies, the guitars and even the bass line. "It was an intentional rip-off," said the band's Colin Routh.

The program is classified in the NCAA's Division I, and the team competes in Conference USA. They previously participated in the Southwest Conference (1914–1996) and  the Western Athletic Conference (1996–2005).
The Owls play their home games in Tudor Fieldhouse, which they have called home since 1950. Previously known as Rice Gymnasium, it was renamed in honor of Rice alum Bobby Tudor, who spearheaded the 2008 renovation of the facility with a multimillion-dollar donation.  The court is designated "Autry Court" in memory of Mrs. James L. Autry.  Her husband James Lockhart Autry was a descendant of Micajah Autry, who was a hero of the Battle of the Alamo. Her daughter, Mrs. Edward W. Kelley, made a generous donation to the gymnasium building fund in honor of her late mother, an ardent supporter of Rice.

* Maritime & Seafood Industry Museum - official site'The Best of The Dooleys' is the second UK album by pop group The Dooleys. It was their first compilation album and included their five top 30 singles up to this point. It became their biggest-selling album, peaking at No.6 in the UK.
== Background ==
By mid 1979, The Dooleys had scored six hit singles in the UK. The latest single, "Wanted" was the biggest hit of their career and so GTO Records released a compilation containing all the singles so far. The album proved to be a success - the biggest of the group's career, peaking at No.6 in the album charts. The album contained eight tracks from their previous album and four new songs - two of which were single releases. One of the new tracks, "Stand Up Like a Man" had originally been performed by The Shadows in the heats to the Eurovision Song Contest 1975.
Singles included on the album are; "Hands Across the Sea" (a re-recording), "Think I'm Gonna Fall in Love With You", "Love of My life", "Don't Take It Lyin' Down", "A Rose Has to Die", "Honey I'm Lost" and "Wanted". This was the first album by the group to feature youngest sister Helen Dooley who had joined the line-up early in the year, making the group an octet.
In October 2005, a compilation CD of the group was released, containing nine of this album's 12 tracks. Since then all the tracks have been released on CD on re-issues of their original albums.

He was born in Nikšić but his family moved to Cetinje, former administrative center of Montenegro, where he attended elementary and high school. Gojko Berkuljan graduated in 1950 from the School of Arts in Herceg Novi, where he studied painting in the class of professors Milo Milunović and Petar Lubarda. The director of this institution at the time was Milos Vusković, distinguished painter and caricaturist. During the studies Berkuljan participated in preservation and copying of the frescoes in the Patriarchate of Peć and other monasteries located in Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. After graduation, he worked for a couple of years as technical director of the journal 'Pobjeda' (Victory) and conservator for paintings on canvass at the Institute for Protection of the Monuments of History in Cetinje. In 1951 he formed together with his friends and colleagues Branko Filipović and Aleksandar Prijić the artistic group “Trojica”. Their works based on non-common approach were commented as a rebellion against socialist realism and other artistic stereotypes of the period. In 1952 Berkuljan started to work as scenographist at the oldest Montenegrin Theatre “Zetski Dom” and the “Theatre for children Rajko Begovič”, where he designed more than 200 paintings of the stage scenery. Before getting retired he also covered briefly the position of the general manager of the National Theatre of Montenegro in Podgorica.
Gojko Berkuljan participated in all most important events related to the Montenegrin art scene.  He was also initiator and one of the founders of the international exhibition “Salon 13 November” and initiator of the former Museum of Theatre in Cetinje. During the years the artist created a large number of paintings that evolved radically in form and substance through different techniques and phases, mostly inspired by Montenegrin landscape and epics.
Berkuljan won many awards and obtained two scholarships: for specialization in Italy (1954) and France (1959). He was a member of ULUCG (Association of Visual Artists of Montenegro).

==History==
In December 1940, it was decided to build an airfield near the village of Wardle, Cheshire, north-west of Nantwich, as one of a number of airfields intended to boost the fighter defence of Merseyside. The airfield was built by Peter Lind Ltd in 1941–1942, and had three concrete runways of between  and .
By the time the airfield was complete, the need for fighter defences for the North-West of England had declined, so it was decided to use it for training, with the station opening as a Relief Landing Ground for No. 5 Service Training Flying School (SFTS) based at RAF Ternhill in Shropshire on 14 March 1942. 5 STFS was renamed No. 5 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit ((P)AFU) on 13 April 1942, continuing operations both from Ternhill and its satellites, including Calveley, which was the only one of Ternhill's satellites to have hard runways. In May 1943 RAF Calveley became the main base for No. 17 (P)AFU, equipped with 174 Miles Master trainers, which moved from RAF Watton in Norfolk. To accommodate the unit's large number of aircraft, RAF Wrexham served as a satellite airfield.
17 (P)AFU disbanded on 1 February 1944, as part of a shuffle of training units which saw No. 11 (P)AFU, equipped with 132 Airspeed Oxfords, move from RAF Shawbury, freeing the well equipped Shawbury for the Vickers Wellingtons of the Central Navigation School to move from RAF Cranage.
==Posted units and aircraft==
* From 13 Mar 1942 until May 1943 No. 5 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit used the airfield as a Relief Landing Ground from their main airfield at RAF Ternhill flying Miles Masters.
* No 11 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit from May 1943 using RAF Wrexham as a satellite.
* From May 1943 until 1 Feb 1944 No 17 (Pilot) AFU moved from RAF Watton and RAF Bodney using RAF Wrexham as a satellite  flying the Airspeed Oxford and Avro Anson then using Harvards Hawker Hurricanes and Miles Masters
* 21 Jun 1945 until Oct 1945 - No 5 Aircrew Holding Unit.
* 22 Oct 1945 until May 1946 - No 22 Service Flying Training School flying Harvards moved to RAF Ouston.
==Current use==
The airfield is now farmland and part of an industrial estate.

A Democrat, he served five terms (1963–1972) representing the 3rd Middlesex District in Cambridge in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He served as Deputy State Treasurer of Massachusetts from 1972–1980.
== Early life and family ==
Hickey was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to William T. Hickey, a funeral director and embalmer, and Margaret (Kedian) Hickey. He was a graduate of the Cambridge Public School system. Hickey's father established the William T. Hickey Funeral Home in Cambridge in 1934. In 1959, he graduated from the New England Institute of Embalming and Funeral Directing and joined his father in a family business, the William T. Hickey & Son Funeral Home at 175 Huron Avenue in Cambridge.
In 1951, at the young age of thirteen, he met a Cambridge City Councillor by the name of Edward J. "Eddie" Sullivan. Through this friendship he became interested in a life of public service. He watched his friend go from city councillor to mayor of Cambridge and go on to become clerk of courts for Middlesex County in Massachusetts. 
On June 4, 1960, Hickey married Patricia Eileen Hughes at St. Peter's Church in Cambridge. They have three daughters, Sheila, Margaret and Patricia, and  five grandchildren, Timothy, Abigail, Meaghan, Colin and Liam.
== Political career ==
In 1962 Hickey ran for Representative from the 3rd Middlesex District. He won a competitive Democratic primary for the seat vacated by Lawrence F. Feloney, followed by a win in the November general election.  He won reelection in 1964, 1966, 1968 and 1970.
Representative Hickey took his oath of office on January 1, 1963 at the age of 24, being the youngest member of the legislature. Notable members of the Class of 1963 included: Congressman Joseph D. Early of Worcester, Governor Michael S. Dukakis who became the Democratic nominee for president in 1988, David M. Bartley who became Speaker of the Massachusetts House, and Thomas W. McGee who would also go on to become Speaker. 
He voted to replace four of the constitutional offices in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In 1964, Robert Q. Crane as state treasurer replacing John T. Driscoll. Also in 1964, Thaddeus Buczko as state auditor replacing Thomas J. Buckley. In 1967, John F.X. Davoren replacing Kevin H. White as secretary of state. In 1969, Robert H. Quinn replacing Elliot Richardson as attorney general.
Hickey served on the following House committees: Committee on Cities, Committee on Counties, Committee on Federal Financial Assistance, and the Committee On Ways and Means. Additionally, he served on the Special Commission on Mental Health.

***The article is well-referenced; period.  Or at least well-referenced compared to the usual crap we see at AfD. This doesn't have anything to do with it being notable or not.

He is most noted for his authorship of various textbooks.
== Biography ==
'Physica Generalis' (1776).
'Physica Particularis' (1770).
Horvath entered the Jesuit order at 19 years of age (17 October 1751 in Trencsén (Trenčín), became a university professor, and subsequently authored the well-known Latin textbooks 'Physica 'Generalis' (1767/1782, 496pp) and 'Physica 'Particularis' (1770/1782, 472pp). Various other works are attributed to Horvath, including 'Elementa Physicae' (1790/1807/1819, 656pp) which is a condensed revision of 'Physica Generalis' and 'Physica Particularis', 'Institutiones Logicae' (1767/1813, 118pp), 'Elementa/Institutiones Matheseos' (1772/1782, 456pp), 'Institutiones Metaphysicae' (1767/1817, 362pp) and 'Declaratio Infirmitatis Fundamentorum' (1797, 188pp) which is a philosophical text regarding speculations on the nature of God posited by Immanuel Kant. This collection of works, including metaphysics/logic and physics, was typical of Jesuit academics teaching under the Ratio Studiorum (1599). The books were published in Nagyszombat (Hungary), Augsburg (Germany), Eger and Buda (Hungary), Velencze (Principality of Transylvania), Madrid (Spain), Vienna (Austria) and Venice and Turin (Italy), including multiple editions and/or printings of each volume.
'Physica Generalis' deals primarily with classical mechanics and celestial mechanics, for example including a Copernican (heliocentric) diagram of the solar system, missing Uranus and Neptune, and a diagram of a highly-elliptical comet. 'Physica Particularis' includes treatments of fluid mechanics, heat transfer and optics, and several chapters deal scientifically with the nascent field of electricity, where Horvath is thought to be the first Central European author to present electricity and magnetism in the same chapter. The coverage is eclectic, including topics like the aurora borealis, combustion, sound, rainbows, botany and lightning. The work is also notable for its reliance on experimental physics, since this branch of physics was still emerging as a reputable field, especially among Jesuit academics. For example, Horvath cites experiments on electricity by Benjamin Franklin (1754). In addition to his physics textbooks, Horvath published the mathematics textbook 'Institutiones Matheseos', including sections covering arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and conic sections.
He was among the most important Central European physics textbook authors in the 18th century (see also Andreas Jaszlinszky as well as Leopold Biwald and Joseph Redlhamer), and an innovative proponent of Newtonian mechanics, which in hindsight was the correct theory rather than the Cartesian mechanics popular among some Continental philosophers. By promoting the methods of Copernicus and Newton, influenced by the approach of Borgondio and Boscovich, Horvath represents a (correct) departure from "accepted" thinking in that region of Europe, and his works were widely distributed. He continued to publish and instruct students from a secular professorship after the Jesuit order was suppressed in 1773, and during his tenure the university faculty moved to modern-day Hungary (1777) to become the renowned University of Budapest.
Full-text scanned versions of 'Physica Particularis' (1782/1775/1770/1817), missing some pages and illustrated plates, are available online. Similarly, scanned copies of 'Physica Generalis' (1780/1775/1772) are available online. Images of the textbook title pages are also available. Each of these textbooks is worth approximately $150 depending on condition.

==Life and career==
Packard was born in Warren, Ohio on November 5, 1863, to Warren and Mary Elizabeth Doud Packard. After attending Lehigh University, he joined his older brother William Doud Packard (1861-1923) in founding the Packard Electric Company there in 1890 where they manufactured incandescent carbon arc lamps. His sister Alaska P. Davidson (1868-1934) later became the first female FBI agent.
The brothers then formed a partnership with Winton Motor Carriage Company investor George L. Weiss called Packard & Weiss in 1893. The first Packard automobile was released in 1899. In 1900, the company incorporated as the Ohio Automobile Company and was renamed the Packard Motor Car Company in 1902. The company relocated to Detroit in 1903. The company eventually merged with the Studebaker Corporation in 1954, and the last Packard was made in 1958.
Following the company relocation to Detroit, the Packard brothers focused on making automotive electrical systems via the Packard Electric Company. General Motors acquired the company in 1932, renaming it Delphi Packard Electric Systems in 1995. The company was spun off and became independent of GM in 1999.
Packard fell ill three years before his death and spent his last 16 months at the Cleveland Clinic Hospital.
==Education==
James Ward Packard attended Lehigh University, enrolling in 1880 and graduating in 1884 with a degree in mechanical engineering.
==Legacy==
Packard Park in Warren, Ohio is on land donated by the Packards. Packard Lab at Lehigh University was funded by him and completed in 1929, the year after he died.
In 1927, Packard commissioned the world's most complicated watch to never be outdone, but banker Henry Graves Jr. surpassed his rival in 1933 to become the owner of the most complicated watch ever made, spending 60,000 CHF, nearly five times the price paid by Packard.

The highway extends  from its southern terminus at SR 204 south of the hamlet of Etna to the northern terminus at SR 37 approximately  southeast of Johnstown.
== Route description ==
Former school at Etna
SR 310 starts at a T-intersection with SR 204 in Liberty Township in rural northern Fairfield County. A little more than  north of SR 204, SR 310 meets Palmer Road, which straddles the Fairfield–Licking county line.  Less than  after crossing into Licking County's Etna Township, SR 310 arrives at a diamond interchange with Interstate 70 (I-70).  
North of I-70, SR 310 enters into the hamlet of Etna, passing by a few residential streets before arriving at a signalized intersection with the four-lane divided U.S. Route 40 (US 40).  For the next mile, SR 310 passes by a mix of residential subdivisions and open fields.  At the Refugee Road intersection, SR 310 enters Pataskala.  SR 310 continues to traverse both houses and open space for approximately the next .  At that point, SR 310 continues into Pataskala along Main Street through a heavily residential portion of the city, en route to intersecting SR 16.
Meeting SR 16 (Broad Street) at a T-intersection, SR 310 turns east and follows SR 16 for one block, to the Township Road intersection.  There, SR 310 resumes its northerly trek, and passes along the eastern edge of Broadview Golf Course, through the County Road 28 intersection.  North of there, SR 310 enters a more rural setting, while serving as the eastern city limits of Pataskala.  Through this area, SR 310 continues to pass by the occasional residential subdivision.  SR 310 passes through a "staggered" intersection Hollow Road, then upon meeting Township Highway 148, SR 310 becomes the boundary between Jersey Township and St. Albans Township.  Continuing through farmland, with scattered houses along the way, SR 310 arrives at the Morse Road (County Road 25) intersection.  Further north, SR 310 goes by the Willow Run Golf Course.  At the northeast corner of that golfing facility, SR 310 meets SR 161.
Northerly from SR 161, SR 310 turns entirely into St. Albans Township, now traversing a mix of woods and open space, while passing the occasional residence.  Through this stretch, SR 310 intersects Jersey Mill Road (County Road 91), Jug Street (County Road 22) and County Road 33, and crosses over the Raccoon Creek.  SR 310 then passes into Licking County's Liberty Township before arriving at its northern terminus at SR 37.
==History==
When established in 1932, SR 310 existed entirely within Licking County. At the time, it only extended across the portion of its current routing from US 40 in Etna to SR 16 in Pataskala.
In 1937, SR 310 underwent extensions at both the southern and northern ends of the route.  To the south, SR 310 was extended into Fairfield County to its current southern terminus at a then newly extended SR 204.  North of Pataskala, SR 310 was designated along a previously un-numbered road up to a junction with SR 37 southeast of Johnstown.

Community television stations are most commonly operated by non-profit groups or cooperatives. However, in some cases they may be operated by a local college or university, a cable company or a municipal government.
==Community television by country==
===Australia===
===Austria===
===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication is promoting the advocacy with the government in relations to community Television with other organizations since its emergence from 2011. BNNRC has been addressing the Community Television access issue for over a decade, helping to bridge the information gap in Bangladesh
===Brazil===
In Brazil, in the 1980s, it appeared as a Free TV, also called Street TV, characterized by the production of educational-cultural videos for exhibition in a closed circuit or in public square, as a proposal of the struggles for redemocratization of the country.
Today, a community television are operated across by Conditional Access Service (pay-TV), a public concession for free use by nongovernmental entities, in the cable TV system or in the Citizenship Channel (in terrestrial digital TV).
There are about 90 TVs. Each television is formed by an association of entities. It is a channel provided for in Brazilian laws: No. 8977/1995 and No. 12485/2011.
===Canada===
Most community channels in Canada are owned and operated by cable companies, as a requirement of license imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). However, due to the state of concentration of media ownership in Canada, whereby the vast majority of Canada's conventional television stations are now owned by national media conglomerates and offer very little locally oriented programming, terrestrial community channels began to emerge in the 2000s in many smaller markets not directly served by their own commercial television stations. Community channels of this latter type are generally operated by local non-profit groups.
===Indonesia===
Since late 2002, community television in Indonesia is regulated as Community Broadcasting Institution (Indonesian: 'Lembaga Penyiaran Komunitas' or LPK).
===Ireland===
Community television is in its infancy in Ireland.  Licensing is administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. Saorview launched on 31 October 2010 giving an addition platform for Community television, however so far Community TV is only available on UPC's Irish cable and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) network.  The main broadcasters are P5TV (UPC 801), Cork Community TV (UPC 802) and DCTV (UPC 803).  These groups produce content and then they can have it transmitted by an organisation that has a license to broadcast (Terrestrial television or Cable Television).
As well as the above, there are also web based channels which are likely to become more dominant in the not too distant future as broadband coverage and quality improves (and as the technologies converge).  Examples of these are Teilifis Gaeltacht Muscrai (TGM) based in the rural Irish speaking WestCork Gaeltacht, and Fingal Community TV based in Dublin.
===United Kingdom===
Probably the longest standing community television service in the UK is Swindon Viewpoint, which is over 40 years old. It claims to operate according to the "core community TV principles of access and accountability", and its board is elected by its public.
===United States===
'Public, educational and government access television' is a form of non-commercial mass media where ordinary people can create content which can be viewed through cable TV systems. Standard public-access television is often grouped with Educational-access television and Government-access television (GATV) channels, by the acronym 'PEG'. PEG Channels are typically only available on cable television systems.

==References=='Earle Francis Brucker Sr.' (May 6, 1901 – May 8, 1981) was an American catcher, coach and interim manager in Major League Baseball. After a long minor league career in the Pacific Coast and Western leagues – and after missing three full seasons (1927–29) in his prime due to arm trouble – Brucker was an unusually old rookie player in the Major Leagues. He made his debut on April 19, 1937, not quite three weeks shy of his 36th birthday.
A longtime San Diego resident who was born in Albany, New York, Brucker threw and batted right-handed, stood  (180 cm) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). He made his first appearance in professional baseball in 1924 for the Seattle Indians of the Pacific Coast League, but it would be 13 years before he would reach the majors. He was even a playing manager in the Western League during this apprenticeship.
He played his entire MLB career (1937–40; 1943) for the Philadelphia Athletics and served as a coach under legendary A's manager Connie Mack for nine full seasons, 1941–49. In 241 total games, he batted .290 in 707 at bats, with 12 home runs and 105 runs batted in. In 1938, his best campaign, Brucker batted .374 with 64 hits in 171 at bats, three homers and 35 RBI. During his long tenure with Philadelphia, he also witnessed the brief major-league career of his son Earle Brucker Jr., also a catcher, who appeared in two games for the Athletics at the end of the 1948 season.
After leaving the A's, Brucker Sr. coached for the St. Louis Browns (1950) and the Cincinnati Reds (1952). During the latter season, from July 30 to August 3, he served as interim manager of the Reds for five games during the transition between Luke Sewell and Rogers Hornsby as Cincinnati's permanent manager. His sixth-place Reds won three of five during his brief tenure. Following that season, Brucker managed in the Reds' farm system for two additional campaigns before leaving the game.
In 1960, Brucker was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. Brucker died in San Diego, at age 80.

* Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce'Tadeusz Pyka' (May 17, 1930 – May 23, 2009) was a former Polish communist politician, who served as a Deputy Prime Minister of Poland. In August 1980, he led a government commission which attempted to end a strike in the Polish city of Gdańsk, but he was replaced on August 21 without an explanation offered by state radio at the time for the change.
==Political career==
Pyka was educated in the engineering of metallurgy. Pyka was a deputy to the Sejm, the Polish legislative body, for three consecutive terms from 1972 to 1980. In 1974, he became a deputy to the Chairman of the Planning Commission of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party. He was also a Deputy Prime Minister of Poland from October 23, 1975 to August 24, 1980, and a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers Party until 1980. In 1980, he was also briefly a deputy to a member of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party.  During the period of martial law in Poland in 1981 he was interned for a year and had charges pressed against him.
===Gdańsk negotiations===
In August 1980, due to economic difficulties, workers in the Polish city of Gdańsk went on strike. Around the middle of that month, the Polish government declared that it had created a commission that would converse with the strikers. The commission was led by Pyka, who was a relative newcomer to the inner circle of the communist Polish United Workers' Party, and a "junior man" when compared to Poland's other Deputy Prime Ministers. He was described as a "minor Party functionary" and a "close ally of Edward Gierek", the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. Pyka stated that he would have "nothing to do" with the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, the main representative body of the Gdańsk  strikers, especially with members Lech Wałęsa and Andrzej Gwiazda, as well as Anna Walentynowicz. Pyka argued that the Strike Committee was illegal, and that it did not represent the workers it claimed to. He was replaced as leader of the commission with Mieczysław Jagielski on August 21. State Polish Radio at the time gave no explanation as to why Pyka was replaced.
==Post-political career==
He was a professor of economics at the Górnośląska Wyższa Szkoła Handlowa in Katowice.  He died on May 23, 2009.

==References=='Goodwin Stadium' was a stadium in Tempe, Arizona. It hosted the Arizona State University Sun Devils football team until they moved to Sun Devil Stadium in 1958, as well as the team for local Tempe High School until 1969. The stadium held 15,000 people at its peak and was opened in 1936.  The first football game played was on Friday, October 3, 1936, when the Arizona State Teacher's College Bulldogs defeated California Institute of Technology 26-0.  The last football game played was on September 20, 1958, when ASU beat Hawaii 47-6 in front of 19,000 fans.
The stadium was named for Garfield Goodwin, former mayor of Tempe, member of the Arizona State Teachers College Board of Education and receiver on the 1899 Tempe Normal School football team.
==Construction==
Goodwin Stadium first hosted the Sun Devils in the 1936 season, after the completion of its west side grandstand. The western portion was a Public Works Administration project, built at a total cost of $92,000. This first grandstand had room for 4,000 spectators.  The contractor for Goodwin Stadium was Del E. Webb Construction Company.  The engineer for Goodwin Stadium was L.M. Fitzhugh.
The eastern portion was built by the Works Progress Administration in 1940-41. Designed by influential Phoenix architects Lescher & Mahoney (with Kemper Goodwin as one of the project's superintendents), it cost $87,500 to build and seated an additional 5,300. In 1946, to accommodate overwhelming growth in the university, a men's dormitory was added to the grandstand at a cost of $275,000. The dormitory housed 88 men at normal capacity.  The East stands also served as Haigler Hall, a men's dormitory.  It was named after Charles Haigler, a member of the first football team at Tempe Normal School.
==Martin Luther King address==
On June 3, 1964, Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered an address at Goodwin Stadium, titled "Religious Witness for Human Dignity". The address was not noted in many biographies of King and was only found in 2013, when a woman discovered it along with reels from civil rights leader Lincoln Ragsdale's radio show at a Goodwill store. University president G. Homer Durham, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), showed progressivism in inviting King to speak at the university, since the LDS Church did not fully recognize racial equality until 1978.
==Demolition and site reuse==
By the 1970s, Goodwin Stadium had fallen into disuse, while the land it sat on was needed by the university. In 1976, the west side of Goodwin Stadium was knocked down, with the east side following in 1978. A road (Lemon Street) was extended through the property; a parking garage now occupies the southern half of the footprint, while several buildings of the W. P. Carey School of Business were constructed on the site north of the extended Lemon Street. A plaque placed on the northwest corner of the parking garage, at College Avenue and Lemon Street, commemorates Goodwin Stadium's existence.

* Recording of "Religious Witness for Human Dignity"'Stanton Hill ("Stan") Delaplane' (12 October 1907 – 18 April 1988) was a travel writer, credited with introducing Irish coffee to the United States. Called "last of the old irreplaceables" by fellow-columnist Herb Caen, he worked for the 'San Francisco Chronicle' for 53 years, winning a Pulitzer Prize for reporting in 1942.
==Early life==
Delaplane was born in Chicago, Illinois, and attended high school there and in Santa Barbara and Monterey, California.
==Career==
Delaplane's career as a journalist began as a writer for 'Apéritif Magazine' from 1933 to 1936, when he joined the San Francisco Chronicle as a reporter He won the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1942 for a depiction of the State of Jefferson, a state that residents of far northern California and southern Oregon proposed semi-seriously in order to publicize their grievances. He also won National Headliner Awards in 1946 and 1959. In 1944 and 1945 he served as a war correspondent in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II.
===Irish coffee===
After drinking Irish coffee at Shannon Airport in Ireland, Delaplane convinced Jack Koeppler, then owner of the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco, to start serving it at his bar. On November 10, 1952, the two spent hours perfecting the Irish method for floating the cream on top of the coffee, reportedly to the point where Delaplane almost passed out on the cable car tracks outside.
===Postcards===
Beginning in 1953 Delaplane published a syndicated humorous travel column called "Postcards". In later years Delaplane would write his travel dispatches (which he called "postcards") from his home on Telegraph Hill, finishing them over a martini and cigarettes by the piano at the Washington Square Bar and Grill before sending them to the newspaper building by messenger. His writing style was characterized by very short sentences and sentence fragments, which he said was for the benefit of San Francisco Municipal Railway riders who had to read the paper while being jostled by the commuter train. He was known for exaggerating and sometimes fictionalizing his stories, and wrote often of the North Beach neighborhood and various eccentric people who lived in San Francisco. About his writing style,  British commentator Alistair Cooke wrote,  "Stanton Delaplane wrote like a young and happy and wholly successful pupil of Hemingway. He rarely wrote sentences of more than six or seven words and he could go weeks without calling on an adjective. His peculiar magic, which I often probed into and never discovered, was to keep these bare sentences rollicking along in the most effortless way, running as clean as spring water over the bed of a brook. He could not help being an entertaining writer and that is a gift that very few writers indeed can legitimately claim from the double-domed philosophers to the light-weight journalists."
===Ding dong daddy===
Delaplane's second Headliner award was for a semi-fictionalized account of Francis Van Wie, a Muni conductor arrested for bigamy for keeping 18 wives. Delaplane promoted the story into a nationwide sensation, calling Van Wie "The Ding-Dong Daddy of the D Car Line" after a popular Louis Armstrong song, "Ding Dong Daddy of Dumas" (in reality, Van Wie never worked on the D line). The story inspired the American swing revival band the Cherry Popping Daddies to write a new song about Van Wei, "Ding-Dong Daddy of the D Car Line", which Warren Sapp and Kym Johnson performed as part of their second-place finish in 'Season 7' of Dancing With The Stars.
Delaplane's final column ran the day he died, and was a reminiscence of old days in North Beach.

==References==The '.416 Taylor' is a rifle cartridge. According to Ken Waters in 'Pet Loads', it was created by Robert Chatfield-Taylor in the early 1970s, with the first rifle in this caliber being a factory barreled Winchester Model 70.  The case is based on the .458 Winchester Magnum necked down to accept .416 caliber bullets.
==Usage==
The .416 Taylor uses a  bullet diameter. With maximum loads, the cartridge is capable of propelling a  bullet at an average of  from a  barrel  yielding a muzzle energy of . The work on this caliber (performed by Waters) was done with an experimental factory Ruger Model 77. He reported that an absolute maximum load of certain listed powders would push a  bullet to , thereby equaling (and perhaps exceeding) the performance of the .416 Rigby (presuming moderate temperatures and barometric pressures). Waters also reported that  bullets could exceed  when propelled by certain listed powders. Under normal hunting conditions, the Taylor cartridge is therefore capable of taking any of the largest and most dangerous game animals in the world. 
Reports from various internet gunboards indicate that shooters and gunsmiths are rebarreling Browning BAR .338 Winchester Magnum rifles with .416 Taylor barrels thereby creating semi-automatic hunting rifles in a true dangerous game caliber.
==Origin==
The cartridge was created to replace the magnum length .416 Rigby which at that time was nearly obsolete, with a cartridge that would fit into a standard length bolt-action rifle. The shorter action rifles are not only easier to carry in heavy cover, but also make it more convenient to carry more ammunition. The advantages to cartridges in .416 inch bullet diameter are that they generally present the shooter with less recoil and flatter trajectory than the larger .458 caliber dangerous game rifles (like the .458 Winchester Magnum). They also have more striking power and penetration than medium bores like the .375 H&H Magnum. The Taylor cartridge is simply a necked down .458 Winchester Magnum with no changes. They have the same shoulder height and angle as the .264 Winchester Magnum. The 416 Taylor was a SAAMI standardized cartridge, and was offered as a standard production item by A-Square until it closed in 2011.

==References=='North Carr' is the last remaining Scottish lightship . She is  in length,  in beam and 268 tons.
The purpose of the vessel was to warn mariners by sight, light or sound of the dangers of the North Carr rocks which are situated 1.7 miles off Fife Ness at the turning point for vessels sailing between the Forth and the Tay. The 'North Carr' is currently berthed in the Victoria Dock, Dundee, awaiting restoration as an exhibition space.
==History==
She was built by A. & J. Inglis Ltd, (part of Harland and Wolff) for the Northern Lighthouse Board for £15,000 at Pointhouse Shipyard, Glasgow in 1932 and completed on 27 February 1933. In service she was anchored off Fife Ness until 1975. From then she served as a tourist attraction in Anstruther harbour. She is the third and last vessel to carry the name - the first was borrowed from Trinity House London, the English counterpart of Northern Lighthouse Board. The second was purpose built in Dundee, reported to have sat so low in the water that her decks were always awash and the only way up to the light was up a rope ladder in the rigging - no mean feat at the best of times.
She created quite a stir in Edinburgh on account of her fog horn being tested while lying at ¾ mile outside Granton in the Firth of Forth. As the fog horn had a range of approximately 10 miles, north Edinburgh could hear it loud and clear and the complaints to the office, newspapers and police were numerous - particularly as it was being sounded in clear weather. "Hundreds of city dwellers have had no sleep over three consecutive nights"; "The most flagrant individual breach of the peace is as nothing compared with the ceaseless boom and consequent suffering of the past three nights"; "Firth of Forth torment"; "An Edinburgh grievance which has left rankling memories in the selection of Granton for the fog horn test" were typical of statements made and written at the time .
On 8 December 1959, the lightship was the subject of a tragic rescue mission. After the lightship broke her moorings and began to drift in heavy seas, the Broughty Ferry lifeboat (The 'Mona')  was launched. Her crew of eight was lost when the lifeboat capsized. The lightship and its crew survived and after repair was towed back to its station.
The North Carr Lightship moored in Dundee in early 2007.
==After decommissioning==
The lightship was used as a museum in Anstruther for years after she left service. She was purchased from a scrapyard in 2010 for £1 and funds were sought by the charity Tay Maritime Action (Taymara) to restore her as an exhibition space on the Dundee waterfront. However, due to a lack of funding, the lightship is yet to receive the new lick of paint or restoration she needs. She is currently docked in the West Victoria Dock near to .

On 27 November 2008 he was appointed as a new assistant manager for AIK following the departure of former assistant Nebojša Novaković earlier the same month in protest against the board’s decision to sack Rikard Norling. Together with other assistant manager Christer Swärd and manager Mikael Stahre, AIK managed to win both Allsvenskan and Svenska Cupen during their first year together.
The following year, AIK started by winning the Supercupen against the recent league runners-up IFK Göteborg. But the rest of the season became a big disappointment, and Stahre left the club for Greek outfit Panionios G.S.S. in April 2010. Alm remained as assistant manager during caretaker Björn Wesström's stay and later appointed Alex Miller's stay. When Miller and AIK during mutual consent split up, Alm later on was appointed as AIK's new manager in December 2010. Novaković rejoined the team staff as assistant manager together with Swärd.
Alm became a successful coach for AIK and ended on the second place in both 2011 and 2013 in the Allsvenskan.
===Vejle Boldklub===
Alm was linked with a job at the vacant job at Brøndby IF in May 2016, but was instead presented as the new manager of Vejle Boldklub 2 months later.
After a disappointing season, finishing on the 9th place, Alm confirmed on 30 May 2017, that he wouldn't continue as the head coach of Vejle.
===BK Häcken===

=== Accusations of fake news ===
On 27 November 2016, 'The Sunday Times' published a story claiming that South African radio and television personality, and former 'Idols SA' judge, Gareth Cliff had "admitted to giving fellow Idols SA judge Marah Louw the spiked drink that led to her notorious slurring and swearing on live TV", with further suggestions made that the incident had resulted in Louw's contract not being renewed. As a result of the article, Gareth Cliff was the victim of many insults on social media, before releasing a statement on Facebook confronting the false allegations printed in the 'Sunday Times'. Susan Smuts, Managing Editor of the 'Times', responded to Cliff's lawyer, admitting that there had been "misinterpretations". Cliff, via his lawyer, demanded an unreserved apology from the 'Times'.

==References=='RAF Mount Batten' was a Royal Air Force station and flying boat base at Mount Batten, a peninsula in Plymouth Sound, Devon, England. Originally a seaplane station opened in 1917 as a 'Royal Navy Air Service Station Cattewater' it became 'RAF Cattewater' in 1918 and in 1928 was renamed RAF Mount Batten. The station motto was 'In Honour Bound' which is the motto of the Mountbatten family.
Today, little evidence of the RAF base remains apart from several memorials, some aviation-related road names, the main slipway and two impressive Grade II listed F-type aeroplane hangars dating from 1917.
==History==
===Royal Naval Air Station Cattewater===
As early as 1913 the sheltered Cattewater in Plymouth Sound was used for seaplane trials and in 1916 plans to open a Royal Navy seaplane station were agreed. In February 1917 RNAS Cattewater was opened. It had a hangar for aircraft, storage and maintenance and a stone pier with a railway track that enabled a steam crane to place the seaplanes in and out of the water. The first aircraft based there were the Short 184 and these were soon followed by other seaplanes. Operational flying was carried out from Cattewater, mainly coastal patrols.
===Royal Air Force Station Cattewater===
With the formation in April 1918 of the Royal Air Force the station became RAF Cattewater. The station was little used but in 1919 the station became notable with the arrival of the Curtiss NC 4 flying boat making the first aerial crossing of the Atlantic. From 1923 the station was re-built and extended and was re-opened in 1928.
===Royal Air Force Station Mount Batten===
Mount Batten from Plymouth Hoe
On 1 October 1928, following re-building, the old Cattewater seaplane station was opened as RAF Mount Batten. The main reason for the new station was to provide a base for flying boats to defend south-west England. The first squadron (No. 203 Squadron RAF) became operational with the Supermarine Southampton.
The station also became a base for high-speed air sea rescue launches on which, in the 1930s, was employed Aircraftman Shaw, better known as T. E. Lawrence, who had suggested the change of name. The base is actually named after Captain Batten, a Civil War commander who defended this area at the time, with the Mountbatten family motto taken as the station's motto.
With the start of the Second World War there was an increase in operational flying from Mount Batten. It was also the target for a number of German air raids including the destruction of one of the hangars and a Short Sunderland on 28 November 1940.
At the end of the war the Australian squadron departed for home and the station became a Maintenance Unit. At the end of the 1950s the station became the Marine Craft Training School and from 1961 became the main base of the RAF Marine Branch, with the closure of No. 238 MU, Calshot. Although without any aircraft, the station became the centre for both marine craft until the marine branch closed in 1986 and the School of Survival until it moved in 1992. It also housed No. 3 Maritime Headquarters Unit of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force providing Communications and Operations Room personnel.

==External links==Primarily in Austroasiatic languages (also known as Mon–Khmer), in a typical word a 'minor syllable' is a reduced (minor) syllable followed by a full tonic or stressed syllable. The minor syllable may be of the form  or , with a reduced vowel, as in colloquial Khmer, or of the form  with no vowel at all, as in Mlabri  "navel" (minor syllable ) and  "underneath" (minor syllable ), and Khasi 'kyndon'  "rule" (minor syllable ), 'syrwet'  "sign" (minor syllable ), 'kylla'  "transform" (minor syllable ), 'symboh'  "seed" (minor syllable ) and 'tyngkai'  "conserve" (minor syllable ). This iambic pattern is sometimes called 'sesquisyllabic' (lit. 'one and a half syllables'), a term coined by the American linguist James Matisoff in 1973 (Matisoff 1973:86).
Sometimes minor syllables are introduced by language contact. Many Chamic languages as well as Burmese have developed minor syllables from contact with Mon-Khmer family. In Burmese, minor syllables have the form , with no consonant clusters allowed in the syllable onset, no syllable coda, and no tone.
Recent reconstructions of Proto-Tai and Old Chinese also include sesquisyllabic roots with minor syllables, as transitional forms between fully disyllabic words and the monosyllabic words found in modern Tai languages and modern Chinese. In Chinese, minor syllables can be indicated with the absence of diacritic tone markers on the Pinyin letter.

A member of The Republicans, he was elected to the National Assembly for the third constituency of Drôme from 1993 to 1997 and again from 2002 until 2017, with a brief interruption in 2007, when he was appointed Minister of the Overseas by President Jacques Chirac in the last weeks of his second term, replacing François Baroin, who became Minister of the Interior.
==Political career==
A member of the Corps des mines, Mariton was elected to the municipal council of Chevreuse, Yvelines in 1983 and the Regional council of Rhône-Alpes in 1986. In 1989, he became a municipal councillor in Crest. He was national secretary in the Republican Party that was dissolved in 1997 and later in Liberal Democracy, established the same year. In 1998, he was a candidate for president of the Union for French Democracy, receiving 10% of the vote against François Bayrou.
He served as a member of the National Assembly from 1993 until 1997, when he lost his reelection bid. He returned to Parliament in 2002, winning reelection in 2007 and 2012. He represented the third constituency of the Drôme department. He joined the newly-established Union for a Popular Movement in 2002, which became The Republicans in 2015. From March to May 2007, he served as Minister of the Overseas under Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.

During his time in national politics, he was widely seen as a critic of President Sarkozy from 2007 onwards. Although being part of The Reformers, a liberal faction within the party, he opposed the passage of Law 2013-404, which legalised same-sex marriage in France. In the 2016 The Republicans presidential primary, he endorsed Alain Juppé. Mariton is fluent in French, English and Russian.

==References==The 'Naumkeag tribe' were a Native American people who inhabited the area now part of northeastern Massachusetts. The tribe maintained its independence even as it acted as part of the Massachusett Confederacy of tribes.
The territory of the Naumkeag Indians was primarily Essex County, Massachusetts. The name is said to refer to "fishing place," from 'namaas' (fish) and 'ki' (place).
The name 'Naumkeag' in modern usage is often used to refer to the original name for Salem, Massachusetts. Their largest tribal village was located near Salem, but the Native American use of this term applied to the 'people' and not the 'place.'
At the time of the Great Migration to New England in the early 17th century, the Naumkeag population was already greatly depleted. They engaged in a war with the Tarrantine people beginning in 1615. A plague broke out in the area 1617 and took a particularly heavy toll with the Naumkeag people. The Tarrantines took advantage of this weakness, and further decimated their numbers, including killing their sachem, Nanepashemet, in 1619. Upon this death, the general government of the tribe was continued by his widow, the "squaw sachem." His youngest son, Wenepoykin, was Sachem by the time English settlers arrived in 1629, but he may have received assistance from an older family member until he came of age. In 1633 there came another plague, probably smallpox, "which raged to such an extent as to nearly exterminate the tribe."
Numerous precautions were taken by the early Puritan settlers against Indian raids in this territory including the construction of garrisons and posting of sentries, but there is little historical evidence that this tribe was anything but peaceful in their relationship with the Europeans. Toward the end of the 17th century, several towns in the area had secured deeds from the heirs of Wenepoykin, including Salem and Marblehead.

*'Richard Lee Fortman' (February 8, 1915 – November 8, 2008) was a champion checkers player and authority on the game.
==Early years==
Richard Lee Fortman was born on February 8, 1915 in Springfield, Illinois, which was his home throughout his life. His father was a telegraph operator for a railroad, and he would play checkers over the telegraph with other operators during quiet times, playing the games in their heads to avoid detection.
He started playing checkers at home with his father. He started winning these games after he started reading checkers books at the library. He entered the Illinois state checkers championship in 1933 at age 18 and finished in third place. He would go on to win the Illinois state title on six occasions between 1950 and 1978.
==Career==
Fortman graduated from Springfield High School in 1933. He served in the United States Army during World War II in North Africa and Italy. After the war, he became a warehouse foreman for the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company.
He published the seven-volume guide to the game, 'Basic Checkers', considered essential reading for those interested in the game.
Fortman's specialty was correspondence checkers, in which players could take as much as two to three days to consider the board and return the next move to his opponent by postcard, with games taking as long as months or even a year. Fortman won the world postal championship in both 1986 and 1990.
He adapted to the technological changes in the game and would spend hours each day playing checkers over the internet. The first signs that he was in declining health came when he failed to respond to moves in the allotted time.
==Death==
Fortman died at age 93 on November 8, 2008 in Springfield, Illinois. He was survived briefly by his wife, the former Faye Nichols, who died at age 83 on January 4, 2009. The two married on October 14, 1950 and had celebrated their 58th wedding anniversary.
==References=='Jean-Christophe Lagarde' (born 24 October 1967) is a French politician serving as president of the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) since 2014. He succeeded Jean-Louis Borloo after a short interim by Yves Jégo. Lagarde has been the member of the National Assembly for the fifth constituency of Seine-Saint-Denis since 2002.
==Political career==
===Career in local politics===
A native of Châtellerault, Vienne, Lagarde was Mayor of Drancy from 2001 to 2017.
===Career in national politics===
Lagarde has been the member of the National Assembly for Seine-Saint-Denis's 5th constituency since the 2002 legislative election.
In the National Assembly, Lagarde was a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs from 2002 until 2012. He also served as one of the Assembly's vice-presidents, from 2006 until 2007 and again from 2010 until 2012.
In the 2012 presidential election, Lagarde publicly endorsed incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. Following the legislative elections later that year, he joined the newly established UDI led by Jean-Louis Borloo and became the spokesperson of its parliamentary group. In 2013, Borloo included Lagarde in his shadow cabinet; in this capacity, Lagarde served as opposition counterpart to Minister of the Interior Manuel Valls.
In the Republicans’ 2016 presidential primaries, Lagarde and his UDI endorsed Alain Juppé as candidate for the office of President of France. When the party's majority chose François Fillon to run in the 2017 presidential election instead, Lagarde joined Fillon's campaign team. Amid the Fillon affair, he first called on the candidate to quit the election race in favour of Juppé but eventually suspended the UDI's support for the campaign altogether. Ahead of the Republicans' 2017 leadership election, he announced that the alliance between UDI and LR would end indefinitely in the event of Laurent Wauquiez becoming the party's chairman.
Since the 2017 elections, Lagarde has been serving on the Defence Committee. In addition to his committee assignments, he is a member of the French-Algerian Parliamentary Friendship Group, the French-Tunisian Parliamentary Friendship Group and the French delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.
==Political positions==
In 2013, Lagarde was – alongside Yves Jégo – one of two UDI members who voted against his parliamentary group's majority and instead supported the legalization of same-sex marriage in France.
In March 2019, Lagarde opposed Bruno Le Maire's proposal for a so-called GAFA tax.

*The '1986 Alabama Crimson Tide football team' (variously "Alabama", "UA", "Bama" or "The Tide") represented the University of Alabama in the 1986 NCAA Division I-A football season. It was the Crimson Tide's 94th overall and 53rd season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The team was led by head coach Ray Perkins, in his fourth year, and played their home games at both Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa and Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. They finished the season with a record of ten wins and three losses (10–3 overall, 4–2 in the SEC) and with a victory in the Sun Bowl over Washington.
After opening the season with a victory over Ohio State in the Kickoff Classic, the Crimson Tide would win their first 7 games and eventually rise to as high as #2 in the rankings but lost to eventual national champion Penn State and lost out on an SEC championship after losses to LSU and Auburn. Highlights of the season included their first ever victory over Notre Dame and a 56–28 victory over Tennessee that snapped a four-game losing streak to the Vols.
After the season, Ray Perkins resigned on December 31, to become head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League.

It was the Crimson Tide's 96th overall and 55th season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The team was led by head coach Bill Curry, in his second year, and played their home games at both Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa and Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. They finished the season with a record of nine wins and three losses (9–3 overall, 4–3 in the SEC) and with a victory in the Sun Bowl over Army.
Alabama suffered close losses to rivals LSU and Auburn in November but the low point of the season was a 22–12 loss on homecoming to Ole Miss, Alabama's first ever loss against Ole Miss in the state of Alabama. Alabama had zero yards passing in the game. Highlights included a victory over Penn State, Alabama's third consecutive victory over Tennessee, and a come-from-behind 29–28 victory in the Sun Bowl over Army in which quarterback David Smith threw for 412 yards, an all-time bowl record for an Alabama quarterback.
Alabama's road game against Texas A&M, originally scheduled for September 17, was postponed to December 1 when Coach Curry declined to make the trip, worried about oncoming Hurricane Gilbert. When Gilbert made landfall in Mexico and the weather in College Station was clear on gameday, A&M fans called Alabama's coach "Chicken Curry". Alabama won the rescheduled game on December 1 by a final score of 30–10.

'Specific'The '1989 Alabama Crimson Tide football team' (variously "Alabama", "UA", "Bama" or "The Tide") represented the University of Alabama in the 1989 NCAA Division I-A football season. It was the Crimson Tide's 97th overall and 56th season as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The team was led by head coach Bill Curry, in his third year, and played their home games at both Bryant–Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa and Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. They finished the season with a record of ten wins and two losses (10–2 overall, 6–1 in the SEC), as SEC Co-Champions and with a loss in the Sugar Bowl against national championship winner Miami.
Alabama won its first ten games en route to its best record since 1980 and first SEC championship since 1981 season, its 19th overall. Highlights of the season included a 62–27 victory over Ole Miss after falling behind 21–0, a 47–30 victory over Tennessee in a match of unbeatens, and a 17–16 victory over Penn State in which Alabama blocked an 18-yard field goal try with 13 seconds left in the game for the win. The 32-16 win at LSU featured a first for the Crimson Tide, as Alabama safety Lee Ozmint scored the first ever defensive two-point conversion in school history on a 100-yard interception return of an LSU two-point conversion attempt.
However, in the season finale against Auburn—the first Iron Bowl ever played in Auburn, Alabama—the Tigers beat Alabama 30–20. As a result, Alabama, Auburn and Tennessee finished in a three-way tie for the conference championship. Alabama would however receive the conference's Sugar Bowl berth.
In the Sugar Bowl Miami would defeat Alabama 33–25 and be named national champions.
In the week after the Sugar Bowl loss, on January 7, 1990, Bill Curry resigned his position to take the head coaching job at Kentucky.

Headquartered in the UK, it also has editions in the US, Asia-Pacific, India, the Middle East and Turkey.
'Campaign' is published by Haymarket Media Group, which owns more than 70 brands worldwide including FourFourTwo, Stuff, Autocar, What Car? and PRWeek.
==Overview==
'Campaign' publishes a monthly print magazine in the UK as well as daily news and analysis on its websites: campaignlive.co.uk, campaignlive.com, campaignasia.com, campaignindia.in, campaignme.com, and campaigntr.com.
Each spring 'Campaign' releases its School Reports, an assessment of how the biggest advertising agencies performed over the past year. In December, as part of its Annual issue, it names the top agencies, advertising and media networks, advertisers, campaigns, media, and production companies of the year. 'Campaign' also publishes the A-List, a directory of leading executives from the advertising and media industries, at the end of each year.
In May 2016, Haymarket Business Media consolidated their marketing communications publishing portfolio under the Campaign brand, leading to the closure of 'Marketing Magazine,' 'Brand Republic', and 'Media Week.' This also saw the launch of another Haymarket specialist job board, Campaign Jobs.
==History==
The magazine was originally published by the British Printing Corporation and titled 'World's Press News', and, in the late 1960s, was struggling to find a market, but Michael Heseltine then acquired it for Haymarket and hired Maurice Saatchi to rebrand and relaunch the magazine, with design by Roland Schenk, upon which it proved an immediate success  and became known as "the Bible of British adland".
In 2013, 'Campaign' underwent a redesign, dropping its A3 newspaper-size format. In the same year it also launched its first paid-for app, which readers receive as part of their subscription, on the Apple Newsstand service.
=='Campaign' awards==
The Campaign Big Awards recognize the best agencies, campaigns and creative work of the year.
The Campaign Media Awards celebrate creativity in the media business, with categories for both media agencies and media owners.

*The congregation of 'Immanuel Lutheran Church' in Valparaiso, Indiana, was founded in 1862 by 69 German families. The church building was erected in 1891 by Henry Lemster and his son, Charles. A fire gutted the building in 1975, marks of which can still be seen on the altar and pews. The Immanuel Lutheran congregation moved to a new site on Glendale Boulevard, while 60 members formed a new congregation named Heritage Lutheran Church and restored the historic building.
An undated old photo shows a taller steeple and a two-story parsonage adjacent to the parish hall, which is no longer extant. A photo from the courthouse tower northward, c. 1900, shows the taller steeple on the church.
The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
==Immanuel Lutheran School==
===Immanuel Lutheran School===
Immanuel Lutheran School, located on Monticello Park Drive and Glendale Boulevard, was founded in 1891. It is partnered with the new Immanuel Lutheran Church. Immanuel is a member of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and claims to have education which is "grounded in faith and inspired towards excellence". With a goal of teaching a new generation of Lutherans in education, faith, and service, Immanuel's education spans kindergarten through 8th grade. Throughout the last 20 years, Immanuel has made investments and improvements aimed at creating a better learning environment for kids. This includes its special education program, which directs its focus to children in kindergarten through eighth grade with special learning needs and disabilities such as autism and asthma.
====Service projects====
Students in Immanuel's middle school undergo service trips each year which reflect Immanuel's goals of faith, service, and education. The projects involve the sixth graders at the nearby Camp Lutherhaven, the seventh graders on a service trip in St. Louis, Missouri, and the eighth graders at Washington D.C.

One year later, Hill won the Rookie of the Year award in the Winston Cup Series. During that season, he competed in all but four of the season's 30 races. Among his highlights were top-five finishes at Rockingham Motor Speedway, Darlington Raceway and Dover International Speedway.  Still running as an independent driver, Hill  returned to the series again in 1976, competing in 22 events, which he recorded only four top-ten finishes and finished 23rd in the standings. In 1977, Hill was able to record four top-tens and a 29th-place finish in points after participating in 16 events. During the following year, he only participated in 14 events, and recorded two top-tens with a 32nd-place finish in the point standings, but benefited form teaming up with Harry Clary to field cars. 
For 1979, Hill teamed up with fellow owner-driver Walter Ballard for a limited slate of events. He finished 34th in points after running seven races. Continuing to race for Ballard in 1980, he finished 50th in points, and only competed in six races. In his final year in the Winston Cup Series, he competed in eight races and finished 43rd in points. Also in 1981, he participated in a NASCAR Late Model Sportsman race at Darlington Raceway.
==Other racing==
While competing in the Winston Cup Series, he also participated in the ARCA Racing Series as well as in USAC. In 2002, Hill participated in a Late model race at Thunderhill Speedway in Mayetta, Kansas.
In 2016 it was announced that A.J. Allmendinger would run a throwback scheme based on Hill's 1977 car for the annual throwback race at Darlington Raceway.

*  Bruce Hill statistics at Racing-Reference.infoThe 'Western Apoi tribe' of the Ijaw people live in Ondo State, Nigeria. The tribe (also called Ijaw Apoi or Apoi) consists of nine settlements: Igbobini, Ojuala, Ikpoke, Inikorogha, Oboro, Shabomi, Igbotu, Kiribo and Gbekebo. The Apoi inhabited higher ground than most of the other Ijaw tribes. They speak the Yoruba language as they no longer speak the Ijaw language. They are bordered to the north by the Ikale and to the west by the Ilaje. The clan also shares border with the Arogbo Ijaw to the south and the Furupagha Ijaw to the east across the Siloko River.
The Apoi people trace their origin to a migration from the Central Niger Delta in present day Bayelsa State and further to an early migration from Ile-Ife. Prior to arriving at their present location, tribal traditions recall a long period of settlement at Ukomu in what is now Furupagha territory.
The Apoi took their name from Apoi (Opoi) the son of Kala-Okun, who accompanied his grandfather Ujo on their way back to Otu-Ife or Ile-Ife. In a group of nine they got lost in trying to trace the route back without the aid of a navigator. So they decided to settle within the vicinity of the Nun river (Apoi creek), where the present village of Apoi is situated. Ujo who bore the title Kalasuwe (KALA-SUWE or KALUSUWE i.e. small god,), died here and his grandson inherited the title.
Subsequently Kalasuwe became a royal title passing through the family lineage of Apoi. The nine lineages formed out of the migrating group founded nine quarters (Idumu), of which only five are remembered, these include, Ogboinbou, Apoi, Okoto-aza or Okoto-aja (the original home of Kalasuwe or Ujo himself and the site of one of his ancestral shrines called Oborowi), Umgbuluama, and Inikorogha. Some descendants of Gbaran migrated from Gbaran settlement within the same area, and with the Apoi founded the villages of Keme-Ebiama, Ajama or Azama, Kassama, and Ogboinbiri, Kolokologbene, and Sampou. Together with Gbaran town, these have collectively become known as Apoi Ibe.
The western Apoi who derived from the Okoto-aja or Okotoaza, Umgbuluama, Apoi and other Idumu’s, migrating with the royal family first settled at Ukomu in the area of Furupagha in the western Niger Delta. They stayed here for a long period of time but had to leave due to the activities of soldiers from the Benin empire (this was the time of the expansion of the Benin empire 1500 AD onwards). Most of the ancestors moved on westwards to found the town of Akpaka. After the reign of Five Kalasuwes (approx. 150-200 years) a gradual process of dispersal set in causing the founding of the towns of Igbobini, Igbotu, Oboro, Ojuala (Oju-Ala), Gbekebo and Kiribo. The royal family moved from Akpaka to found Toru-Abukuba (Apukuba or Opukuba). Later on Toru-Abukuba became the towns of Oboro and Shabomi.
The Western Apoi call Kalasuo Kalasuwe or Kalashuwe and Oborowi, Oborowe. They no longer speak Ijaw language, but a dialect made up of the fusion of Ijaw and Yoruba. Of late they have moved on to adopting the general Yoruba which most of them now speak. At a later stage as part of the Yoruba influence, the rulers took on the Oba title, before switching back to the ancient titles of Kalasuwe. As children of Ujo, at Ile-Ife the ancestral traditions name them as one of the sub-tribes that sprung from King Adumu-Ala (alias Oduduwa). The Apoi are pre-14th century.
The Apoi king is called Oba and the title is Kalasuwe and dual-seats of the throne are in Shabomi and Oboro. 
Here is the list of Apoi Kings, and the communities they rule over:
* Kalasuwe of Apoi Land - Oba (Prof.) Sunday Adejimola Amuseghan
* Olu of Igbobini - Oba Oyedele Raphael
* Odogun of Igbekebo - Oba Bamidele Dabo
* Gbaluwe of Igbotu - Oba Adeniyi Ajayi
* Alakpaka of Kiribo - Oba J.O. Ajayi
* Takunbe of Ikpoke - Vacant
* Jowe of Inikorogha - Oba M.A. Olasehinde
* Ibini of Ojuala - Vacant
* Okiribiti of Shabomi - Vacant
==References==was a Japanese judoka from the Akita Prefecture. He became the first world champion in judo, winning the title at the 1956 World Judo Championships in Tokyo, by beating Yoshihiko Yoshimatsu in the final. As there were no weight classes in the world championships until 1965, Natsui was the only champion in 1956.
==First judo world championship==
===Background===
The International Judo Federation (IJF) was founded in 1951, and five years later IJF organized the first World Judo Championships, held in Tokyo on 5 March 1956.
===Contestants===
Natsui and his teammate Yoshimatsu, both policemen, were the two highest-ranked judoka at the championship; the 36-year-old Yoshimatsu held the rank of nanadan (7th dan), and Natsui rokudan (6th dan), while Pariset from France held yondan (4th dan), and future three-time world champion Anton Geesink from the Netherlands held sandan (3rd dan).  The 1956 championship had 31 competitors from 21 countries.
===Natsui's matches===
In the first round Natsui took only 3 seconds to eliminate the contestant from Cambodia, with the shoulder throw seoi nage. In the second round he met Johannsen from Denmark, and won after 8 seconds, with tai otoshi. The match against Woodrey from Belgium in round 3 lasted 44 seconds, with victory going to Natsui. In the semi-final he met Henri Courtine from France; this match lasted only 8 seconds, with a tai otoshi win to Natsui. In total, Natsui reached the final with a total combined match time of only 63 seconds. The final between Natsui and Yoshimatsu ended with victory to Natsui.
==All-Japan Judo Championships==
Natsui competed several times at the All-Japan Judo Championships in Nippon Budokan in Tokyo—one of the three major tournaments, together with the Olympic Games and the World Championships. In 1951 he finished 8th, he finished 16th in 1952, and 8th again in 1953. He received a bronze medal in 1954, a silver medal in 1955 (losing to Yoshimatsu in the final), and a gold medal in 1957. The All-Japan Judo Championships where not held in 1956 because of the inaugural World Championship competition.
==References==The 'Arogbo Izon People' "are a Clan or Sub-ethnic group of the larger Izon Nation, the 3rd Largest Ethnic Nationatity in Nigeria. Izon Nation is surely the largest Ethnic Group in the Niger Delta Natural Region. They are very valiant and courageous folks. They have domiciled in the Southeastern part of present day Ondo State from about the 9th Century A.D. The Arogbo Izon Ibe covers over One Hundred And Twenty (120) Izon Towns and Villages with headquarters at AROGBO TOWN.
Historically, the Arogbo Izon, a very warlike people, have had trading contacts with neighboring Ijaw groups (Apoi, Egbema) and the Ijebu and Ilaje Yoruba. Most Arogbo are bilingual, speaking dialects of both the Yoruba and Ijaw languages. The Arogbo Izon acted as middle men in the slave trade, selling captives from the interior to Europeans. The Freedom Post was erected at Arogbo Town in 1885. The Arogbo Izon hosted Nana Olomu in protection against colonialists who declared the Itsekiri Chief wanted. They resisted the colonial authorities successfully. The Arogbo Izon have never been defeated in any war. They always rise above trials. Traditionally, the Arogbo Izon encourage intra-tribal marriages amongst themselves and other Izon subgroups to sustain their culture and heritage.  The Arogbo migrated to their present location from the town of Gbaran in the central Niger Delta. Worship of the god Egbesu is particularly strong among the Arogbo Izon.
The founding ancestors of the Arogbo were part of the same migration from Ujo-Gbaraun town. After a brief stop at Oproza, led by EJI  and his younger brother, Perebiyenmo and sister, Fiyepatei. They went on to Ukparomo (now occupied by the towns of Akpata, Opuba, Ajapa, and Ukpe). They stayed here for some time, about the length of the reign of two Agadagbas (military priest-rulers of the shrine of Egbesu). They then moved to the present site of Arogbo. From this place descendants spread out to found the Arogbo Ibe. It was from Arogbo that some ancestors migrated northwards up the old course of the Forcados river and settled near the site of Patani. Living nearby in the upland region were proto Edo or Efa people called Erowha. These ancestors later on intermarried with them and gave birth to the Uvwei and Effurun (Efferun or Efferu the ancestor of the Effurun or Ephron was a descendant of Gbaran) sections of Urhobo people.
During the time of the expansion of the Benin kingdom (1550), the Benin invaded Ukoruama (Lagos). The Arogbo Izon sent soldiers to defend the Ijo living in that region. Their army camp became known as Idumu-Arogbo later shortened to Idumagbo. The Arogbo Izon also successfully halted the advance of the Benin army into the western delta and subsequently the whole of the Izon Ibe. The foundation of the Arogbo Ebe is  clearly pre-11th century AD. The ancestors of the Arogbo lived at Ujo-Gbaraun between 872 – 994 AD. Along with the ancestors of the Gbaramatu and Tuomo they moved to the Escravos region, while the Arogbo Izon ancestors moved further west. web|url=http://www.ijawland.com/arogbo-ibe.html|title=IPA - Ijaw Peoples Association (2009).|access-date=2010-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430162353/http://www.ijawland.com/arogbo-ibe.

==References==Thiri Pyanchi 'Min Thu Wun' (; 10 February 1909 – 15 August 2004) was a Burmese poet, writer and scholar who helped launch a new age literary movement called Khit-San (Testing the Times) in Burma. He is the father of Htin Kyaw, president of Myanmar from 2016 to 2018.
==Distinguished career==
Min Thu Wun (third from the left)
Born 'Maung Wun' at Kungyangon in Mon state in 1909, he was of Mon and Bamar (Burman) descent. He started writing poems at the age of 20 for Rangoon College (later Rangoon University) magazine. It was in university that he, along with the other students of Professor Pe Maung Tin – Theippan Maung Wa and Zawgyi, pioneered the 'Hkit san' style of short stories and poems, published in the university magazine, and 'Ganda Lawka' (World of Books) magazine which he edited, under the tutelage of J S Furnivall, founder of the Burma Research Society. The year 1934 saw the publication of 'Hkit san pon byin' (Experimental Tales) – a collection of short stories to test the readers' reaction, written by Zawgyi, Min Thu Wun and Theippan Maung Wa among others. The writing was distinct and novel in style using shorter sentences and moving away from the traditional literary vocabulary.
In 1935 Min Thu Wun received his master's degree in Burmese literature. He went to study at Oxford University, and achieved a bachelor's degree in literature in 1939.
Whilst Theippan Maung Wa was famous for his prose, Min Thu Wun and Zawgyi were best known for their portrayal of the daily lives of ordinary people and for their appreciation of nature in their poems. Zawgyi became the most respected literary critic, and Min Thu Wun the best loved poet.
==Publications==
#'Nursery Songs for Maung Khway' – 13 songs in Burmese with music and English translations by Gordon H Luce of 60 years ago were reprinted in 2002.
#'Stories for Children' – his translation of 26 stories for children from around the world from 1955 to 1961 were also collected into a book in 1965.
Min Thu Wun's prolific writings on literature, both classical and modern, in numerous articles were later collected into 3 important books.
#'Pan hnin pinzi' – The Tree Trunk and the Blooms (1965)
#'Myanma sa Myanma hmu' – Burmese Life and Letters (1965)
#'Pyinma ngokto' – The Tough Tree Stump (1968)
Min Thu Wun explained in a book review the nature of "light" and "serious" literature. He went on to create the Burmese version of Braille for the blind.
He also helped compile Mon – Burmese and Pali – Burmese dictionaries.
==Politics==
In 1990 he was elected as a National League for Democracy (NLD) Member of Parliament, although he resigned 8 years later under pressure from the military regime. His work has also been banned from publication. A popular publication called 'Sapei Gya-ne' (Literary Journal) was also blocked in its attempt to dedicate its June 1995 issue to Min Thu Wun. He died on 15 August 2004 at the age of 95.

Bassan settlements include: Ezetu (I and II), Koloama (I and II), Sangana, Foropah, Ukubie, Lubia, Azuzuama, Akparatubo, and Ekeni.
Unlike other Ijaw tribes, the Bassan do not have a cultural tradition of common origin. It is believed that each of the villages that make up the clan were settled by separate migrations. As a result, no form of central authority developed among the Bassan. Some of the villages forged temporary alliances; others quarreled with each other over land and fishing rights.
==Significant events==
*2 November 2006: Gunmen kidnap two expatriates (British and American) working for Petroleum Geo-Services (working on contract for Chevron Nigeria Limited). The gunmen claim to have acted on behalf of the Ezetu community, a village near Chevron's Funiwa platform. The community demand that Chevron give them jobs and build a local hospital. According to a Bayelsa government negotiator, contrary to the belief in Yenagoa, the community was actually responsible for the attack. In his words: "When I got to Ezetu 1 community, contrary to what we were made to believe, after a meeting with the people it was made clear to me that the community had sent the youths to take the workers. The community has taken responsibility of the hostage incident".
*1 November 2005: Women from several Bassan communities (Koluama I and II, Ekeni, Forupa, Fishtown, Ezetu I and II and Sangana - also known as the KEFFES communities) conducted a three-day protest outside of Chevron's liaison office in Yenagoa. The women were protesting what they described as Chevron's "insensitivity to their plight".
*15 November 2004: Bassan youths kidnap six expatriates working for Conoil Limited, an oil services firm. The hostages were held at Sangana in Brass Local Government Area (LGA). Angry youths took over Conoil's facilities following the breakdown of employment negotiations with the company's management.
*19 November 2003: Thirty-plus youths from several Bassan communities (Koluama I and II, Ezetu I and II, Foropah, Fishtown, Ekeni and Sangama) invade two Chevron platforms where they held several expatriates and other workers hostage.
==Oil company host communities==
*Ekeni, Ezetu (I and II) are host communities for Peak Petroleum.
*Sangana, Fish Town, Ezetu (I and II), Kolokuama (I and II) are Chevron-Texaco host communities.
Santana is not a member Community of Bassan Clan, it is a member Community of Akassa Clan in Brass Local Govt Area of Bayelsa State.

'Nautica' is now owned and operated by Oceania Cruises, where she is part of their Regatta Class. She was built in 2000 by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France for Renaissance Cruises as 'MS 'R Five'. Between 2002 and 2004 she sailed for Pullmantur Cruises before entering service with her current owners in 2005.
On 30 November 2008 while sailing on the Gulf of Aden the 'Nautica' came under attack by Somali pirates, but was able to escape without any injuries to passenger or crew.
On 20 September 2018, during Storm Ali, the 'Nautica' broke free from her moorings at Greenock in Scotland at the height of the tempest leaving holidaymakers stranded.
==Concept and construction==
'R Five' was the fifth ship in a series of eight identical cruise ships built between 1998 and 2001 by Chantiers de l'Atlantique at Saint-Nazaire, France for Renaissance Cruises. Her keel was laid on 22 March 1999 and she was launched from drydock on 31 July 1999. Following fitting out, the 'R Five' was delivered to Renaissance Cruises on 29 January 2000.
==Service history==
On 1 February 2000 the 'R Five' entered service with Renaissance Cruises on cruises in the Mediterranean. She stayed in service until 25 September 2001, when Renaissance Cruises was declared bankrupt due to financial difficulties caused by the September 11 attacks. Alongside six of her sister ships the 'R Five' was laid up at Gibraltar. In December 2001 she was sold to the France-based Cruiseinvest and alongside her sisters was moved to Marseille, France for a further lay-up.
From June 2002 the 'R Five' was chartered to the Spain-based Pullmantur Cruises for cruising for the Spanish market. In service with Pullmantur she was marketed under the name "Blue Dream", but her registered name remained unchanged. During the northern hemisphere winter seasons she sailed out of Brazilian port as a part of Pullmantur's joint service with CVC. 'R Five' left service with Pullmantur in 2004.
In November 2005 the 'R Five' re-entered service when she was chartered to Oceania Cruises and renamed 'Nautica'. On 30 November 2008 the 'Nautica' was sailing from Safaga, Egypt to Salah, Oman on the Maritime Safety Protection Area established in the Gulf of Aden due to persistent pirate attacks on the area, when at approximately 9:28 AM UTC+3 the ship encountered two Somali pirate skiffs. Captain Jurica Brajcic ordered the ship to take evasive manoeuvres and to sail away at flank speed. The 'Nautica' was able to outrun her attackers, although the ship was fired at eight times. None of the 684 passengers or 401 crew on board were injured in the attack. Following the attack the 'Nautica' proceeded normally to her next scheduled port of call.
'MS Nautica' is scheduled to undergo a significant renovation in June 2020 as a part of the company's $100 million OceaniaNEXT program.

Thus although it is a commercial concern, it also plays a documented role in American plant conservation. (Note: I am not affiliated with the garden in any way; I am just interested in reasonably comprehensive articles on botanical gardens and arboreta.)

*'Delete'. To judge by  this, all that participation in the AHS Reciprocal Admissions Program amounts to is that St. John's has agreed to give members of the other participating gardens a 15% discount on purchases, not that the garden "plays a documented role in American plant conservation." Notability, as usual, requires evidence of significant coverage in reliable secondary sources, and I'm not finding any in a Google search (including Books, Scholar, and News). If sources establishing notability can be provided, I'll reconsider my opinion. Deor (talk) 03:54, 5 December 2008 (UTC)

 "Sandeep Madhav, Satyadev Knit the Story of 'Forgotten Leader' in George Reddy". News18.'Zentralgewerkschaftskommission des Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes in der Tschechoslowakischen Republik' ('Central Commission of German Trade Unions in the Czechoslovak Republic') was a German Social Democratic trade union centre in Czechoslovakia. From 1927 onwards, it was an autonomous structure inside the Czechoslovak labour centre OSČ. The organization was dissolved as Czechoslovakia fell under German occupation.
==Early period==
The organization was founded in July 1919. In 1920 the name 'Gewerkschaftsbund' was adopted, and a headquarters was set up in Liberec. 'Gewerkschaftsbund' emerged as a prominent force in the amongst labour movements in Czechoslovakia, having around 75% of unionized German workers as its members in 1921 (at the time Czechoslovakia had a general unionizing rate of 50%, one of the higher in Europe). Major unions affiliated to 'Gewerkschaftsbund' were Textile Workers (90,878 members in 1921), Metalworkers (39,209 members in 1921) and Miners (37,582 members in 1921).
In 1922, Czechoslovak communists had formed a separate trade union centre, 'Mezinárodní všeodborový svaz' (MVS). However, not all communist trade unionists joined MVS. As of 1926, there were around 15 000 communists inside the 'Gewerkschaftsbund' affiliates.
==Merger into OSČ==
In 1927 'Gewerkschaftsbund' merged into the main Czechoslovak trade union centre, the Social Democratic 'Odborové sdružení československé' (OSČ). The organization continued to function as an autonomous body inside OSČ until the unions were banned following the German occupation.
==Leadership==
Franz Macoun was the general secretary of the organization from 1920 to 1938. Macoun was a Member of Parliament for the German Social Democratic Workers Party between 1929 and 1938.
==Publications==
The organization issued the publication 'Gewerkschafts-Jugend' ('Trade Union Youth') between 1934-1937.

==References=='Joe Wolfe Field' is a baseball field in North Adams, Massachusetts, United States.  The field is home to the North Adams SteepleCats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league based in New England.  The park was built in 1986, with the SteepleCats first utilizing the facility at their inception in the 2002 NECBL season.  It has a seated capacity of 1,800 spectators, with additional seating and standing areas located down either foul line.  The dimensions of the field are 325 ft. down the lines, 358 ft. in the gaps, and 385 ft. in dead center field. The park faces south in the Noel Field Athletic Complex.  The field is lighted for night play with 8 light poles.
In 2012, the Division III MCLA Trailblazers baseball team of the nearby Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts played three home games at Joe Wolfe Field.  The facility is also used by the baseball teams of Drury High School and Charles H. McCann Technical High School, both located in North Adams.  Joe Wolfe Field also hosts other youth sports leagues.
== History ==
Joe Wolfe Field was built in 1986 on the site of Noel Field.  Noel had served as North Adams' main baseball venue for decades, but its grandstand and playing surface had become outdated.  In building Joe Wolfe, a new grandstand and lighting structures were added, and the field itself was renovated.
Then-mayor of North Adams John Barrett III and local sports figure Joe Wolfe were key to fundraising for and building the park.  When Wolfe died in November 1986, shortly after the field's construction, Barrett and others involved in the development decided to name the field after Joe Wolfe.  In addition to his involvement in the field's construction, Wolfe played semi-professional baseball, coached youth teams, and worked in local sports organizations.
In 2005, the field was renovated.  An electronic scoreboard and concession stand were added, and the backstop was improved.
6,714 fans attended a July 4, 2006, game against the Holyoke Giants, won by Holyoke 3–2.  The attendance mark is an NECBL record for regular season, postseason, and All-Star games.
The field hosted the 2007 NECBL All-Star Game.  The visiting South Division All-Stars won the game, which was attended by 4,210 fans.

It was the 54th World Cup. 28 countries competed and each country sent two players. The team purse was $5,000,000 with $1,600,000 going to the winner. The Swedish team of Robert Karlsson and Henrik Stenson won the tournament. This was the second time that Sweden won the World Cup.
==Qualification and format==
The leading 18 available players from the Official World Golf Ranking on 1 September 2008 qualified. These 18 players then selected a player from their country to compete with them. The person they pick had to be ranked within the top 100 on the Official World Golf Ranking as of 1 September. If there was no other player from that country within the top 100 then the next highest ranked player would be their partner. If there was no other available player from that country within the top 500, then the exempt player could choose whoever he wants as long as they are a professional from the same country. World qualifiers were held in September and October. Nine countries earned their spot in the World Cup, three each from the European, Asian, and South American qualifiers. The host country, China, rounded out the field.
The event is a 72-hole stroke play team event with each team consisting of two players. The first and third days are four-ball play and the second and final days are foursomes play.

* Coverage on the PGA Tour's official site
* Mission Hills Golf Club official siteThe 'Battle of the Sinai' was one of the most consequential battles of the Yom Kippur war. An Egyptian attacking force that advanced beyond their line of defense at the Bar-Lev Line was repulsed with heavy losses by Israeli forces. This prompted the Israelis to launch Operation Abiray-Lev (Stouthearted Men) the next day, penetrating the Egyptian line of defense and crossing the Suez Canal.
== Background ==
After Egyptian infantry had successfully crossed the canal and captured the Bar-Lev Line on October 6, Israeli forces made several counterattacks in attempts to push the Egyptians back across the Suez Canal. The Israelis suffered heavy losses in these attacks, and by October 9 Egyptian forces in the Sinai had managed to destroy 500 Israeli tanks. Following this both sides dug in. The Egyptians would not attack for fear of extending their forces beyond the cover of their SAM defences.
In the Golan Heights, Israel had repelled Syrian forces and pushed into Syria itself. By the time the Syrians, now aided by Iraqi and Jordanian expeditionary forces managed to put a halt to the Israeli advance, Israeli forces were 40 km from Damascus. Syrian president Hafez Al-Assad requested his Egyptian ally, Anwar El-Sadat, order an attack in the Sinai, which would draw Israeli attention away from the Syrian front. Sadat consented and ordered the attack. His war minister, Ahmed Ismail, and his chief of staff, Saad El Shazly, opposed the idea; Shazli in particular stated that for Egyptian forces to advance outside their SAM defences would mean their exposure to the Israeli Air Force, which the Egyptian Air Force was too weak to challenge. Sadat insisted that the attack proceed, however, and both Ahmed Ismail and Shazli had no choice but to acknowledge the order.
== Prelude ==
The attack was to proceed on October 13, but was postponed to October 14. Four armored brigades and one mechanized infantry brigade under the command of the Second and Third Armies were to make four independent thrusts. Awaiting for them was a dug-in force of 800 Israeli tanks supported by infantry equipped with SS.11 missiles, as well as American-made LAW and TOW anti-tank missiles. Israel had in the Sinai by October 14 around fifteen brigades totaling nearly 60,000 infantry. The Israeli air force provided intense air cover during the battle.
== Battle and aftermath ==
The Egyptians launched their offensive in the early morning of October 14, at 6:30. The mechanized infantry brigade was to attack in the direction of the Gidi Pass, one armored brigade was to attack in the direction of the Mitla Pass, one brigade was to attack towards Baluza, and two brigades were to attack in the direction of Tasa. As anticipated by many Egyptian officers, the attack was a failure. Encountering stiff Israeli resistance, the Egyptian assault came to a halt after suffering heavy losses, and Egyptian troops retreated back to their lines on the Suez Canal.
Egyptian losses in the battle were 200–250 tanks and up to 1,000 men killed and wounded in action. The 3rd Egyptian Armored Division was completely eliminated and 120 Egyptian prisoners were taken in the battle at Wadi Mab'uk. The Egyptians also lost their Second Army Commander, Saad Mamoun, who suffered a heart attack at the beginning of the day. By contrast, Israeli losses were 50–150 tanks, 60 other armored vehicles and some aircraft. The following day, the Israelis launched Operation Abiray-Lev, crossing the Suez Canal and cutting off the Egyptian Third Army's supply lines.

==Pro Gun Control==
In February 2005, in the wake of a wave of Al-Qaeda violence, the parliament unanimously passed a law giving police wide powers to search for and seize illegal weapons.  Al-Roumi was one of the main proponents of the bill, which makes it easier for police to obtain a warrant to search a private house for illegal weapons.  The law also allows female inspectors to search women's quarters in private homes—quarters which are off limits to men according to Islamic rules.
The parliament passed a similar law in 1992 to deal with a jump in gun ownership after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Lawmakers refused to extend that law in 1994, arguing that possession of weapons was a right.
==Allegations Against Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al Sabah==
In June 2007, al-Roumi, Adel Al-Saraawi, and Musallam Al-Barrak led impeachment proceedings against Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al Sabah on charges of corruption.  Al-Roumi alleged that Sheik Ali intimidated a witness in the case. The minister swore that he called the witness for a meeting to tell him to provide all the information he has in the case.  Sheik Ali resigned on June 27, after being publicly questioned and before a no-confidence vote could be held.
During the impeachment proceedings, al-Roumi also made the following public statement against Sheik Ali: "You have to submit your resignation today because what you said has humiliated the Kuwaiti people." Sheikh Ali had been quoted by the local Al Qabas newspaper as saying that he considers former oil minister Sheikh Ali Khalifa Al Sabah, a defendant in a major graft case, as "my master and that I consult him occasionally on oil issues." 
==Campaign to Reform Foreign Worker Sponsorship System==
In August 2008, al-Roumi declared that he was going to draft a law to scrap Kuwait's foreign worker sponsorship system, under which expatriates must be sponsored by a local employer to get a work permit:  "The government should be the only kafeel...  We have scores of bachelors residing in Kuwait with an equal number of crimes. Many are caused due to the 'trading with humans' issue which taints the reputation of Kuwait."
==Denmark Boycott==
In February 2008, al-Roumi called for the Kuwaiti government to boycott Denmark in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and was quoted as saying, "No Muslim can accept this insult against the Prophet... It is a form of terrorism." 
==Support For Female Candidates==
In 2008, al-Roumi expressed his support for women's active participation in the legislature.  On May 10, 2008, he spoke at the inauguration of a women's campaign headquarters in the Salwa area.  However, on November 30, 1999, al-Roumi voted against granting women the right to vote.
==Runner-Up in Speaker Election==
On June 1, 2008, Jassem Al-Kharafi was re-elected National Assembly Speaker on Sunday, after gaining 52 votes against 11 to his opponent, Abdullah al-Roumi.
==Supports Government Funds for College Tuition==
In 2002 Kuwait started allowing private universities in the country, beginning with the Gulf University for Science and Technology.  On September 28, 2008, MPs Abdullah al-Roumi, Marzouq Al-Ghanem, Ali Al-Rashid, and Adel Al-Saraawi proposed a law to have the government pay half of Kuwaiti students' tuition at these private colleges.
==Reforming Mandatory Retirement Age for Teachers==
On November 28, 2008, al-Roumi joined MPs Khalid Al-Sultan, Hassan Johar, Musallam Al-Barrak, and Marzouq Al-Hubaini in formulating a bill to extend the mandatory retirement age for Kuwaiti teaching staff at Kuwait University from 65 to 70 years.  Al-Roumi argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent academicians by restricting retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. He recommended that a clause be added to the law such that the retirement age can become 70 years and can further be extended to 75 years.

}'Undercover'  are a dance music group from the United Kingdom, who formed in 1991 and had two Top 5 hits in 1992. The vocals on all the group's songs were sung by John Matthews. Band member Steve Mac went on to become a successful songwriter and music producer for many other artists.
== Overview ==
The first single they released was a cover version of Gerry Rafferty's 1978 UK/U.S. hit "Baker Street". It became their biggest hit, when it reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1992, held off from the top only by another dance track, "Rhythm Is a Dancer" by Snap!. It was the eleventh biggest selling single of 1992 in the United Kingdom, and also attained major chart success across Europe, selling over a quarter of a million units in Germany alone.
Undercover released five more chart singles. The second single was a cover of Andrew Gold's "Never Let Her Slip Away", coincidentally also originally from 1978. It reached No. 5, and stayed in the charts in the United Kingdom for a total of eleven weeks. After the success of these two singles, an album, 'Check Out the Groove', was released, reaching No. 26 in the UK Albums Chart. "I Wanna Stay with You" (a cover of the Gallagher and Lyle song) and "Lovesick", both from 1993, managed No. 28 and No. 62, respectively. 
In 1994, Undercover released a new single, "Best Friend", and their second album, 'Ain't No Stopping Us'. The musical style of Undercover's interpretations is best described as cheerful and upbeat, incorporating into the song electronic drums and short piano or organ harmonies, along with repetitive and layered vocal phrases, typical for club songs of the 1990s.

Born in 1950, Abdulsamad studied political science and worked in the Oil Ministry before being elected to the National Assembly in 1981.  While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Abdulsamad affiliates with the National Islamic Alliance, which is a Shia party.
==Supported Severing Ties with Denmark==
On November 6, 2006, the parliament voted 22-15 to approve severing diplomatic ties with Denmark over the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy and spending about US$50 (€39.20) million to defend the prophet's image in the West. Both votes were nonbinding, meaning the Cabinet does not have to abide by them.  Abdulsamad voted in favor of cutting diplomatic ties, saying, ""We have to cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Denmark...We don't have to eat Danish cheese."
==Shiite Mini-series Controversy==
On September 16, 2007,  Abdulsamad and fellow Shia MP Saleh Ashour spoke out against a planned Ramadan soap opera miniseries titled ‘’Sins Have a Price’’ which was to revolve around  and criticize the Shiite form of temporary marriage known as "Mutaa.”  In a public statement, Abdulsamad accused the series of giving "a total distortion of Shiism ... It also incites sectarianism...  It is very provocative and comes at a sensitive time amid the sectarian tension in the region."
 
Abdulsamad charged that besides stoking sectarianism, the serial insults and distorts the Shia faith by mocking temporary marriage, a valid, sanctioned concept in Shiism despite the controversy and social taboos surrounding the practice.
==Expulsion from Popular Action Bloc==
On February 19, 2008, the Popular Action Bloc expelled Abdulsamad and fellow Shiite MP Ahmed Lari for taking part in a ceremony eulogizing Hezbollah's slain top commander, Imad Mughniyeh.  The ceremony's description of the fugitive Lebanese militant — killed in a February 12 car bombing in Syria — as a hero sparked public outrage in a country that holds him responsible for hijacking a Kuwait Airways flight and killing two of its Kuwaiti passengers 20 years ago. The two lawmakers were only expelled from their bloc and remained in the legislature.  After the expulsions of the two, the seven member bloc was down to five members.
==References==Southern Utah Valley, from West Mountain
'West Mountain' is a mountain in Utah, United States that is located  southwest of the city of Provo, and  west of the community of Benjamin. It is home to a radio station tower for KTCE, an FM station licensed to Payson and operating on 92.1 MHz. The mountain is also home to various FM radio translators and an observatory used by students from Brigham Young University (BYU). It can be accessed from a main road that starts near Benjamin. A small census designated place east of the mountain is known as West Mountain as well.
==Geology==
West Mountain's highest point is at . The radio station tower sits on the second-highest point on the mountain, about 2 miles north of the true summit. The mountain is on the southern segment of the Wasatch Range, though it is not connected to the main range. The mountain is located on the southern shore of Utah Lake.
==Radio uses==
The following are translators and radio stations located on the mountain (in order of frequency):
* K202CC-88.3 FM, from parent station KAWZ-FM
* K204BO-88.7 FM, from parent station KUSU-FM. 
* K208BZ- 89.1 FM from parent station KBYU-FM.
* KTCE-92.1-FM, a smooth jazz format station licensed to Payson, Utah. Currently off the air
* K252DB-98.3 FM, from parent station KEGH.
* K260DS-99.9 FM, rebroadcasting KWLO 1580 AM. 
As well as radio stations, the mountain houses several cellular telephone transmitters providing service for AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile. The mountain also contains towers for local emergency services, and state and federal government services. An older tower, once operated by AT&T, is known more commonly as a "Long Line" tower, and was used for microwave communications is located on the north summit. It is the tallest tower on the mountain, and is the most predominant feature. With the invention of fiber optics, the use of these towers gradually declined, and other similar towers have fallen into disrepair. This particular "long lines" tower, is connected to other towers in Riverton, Utah and Levan, Utah. A ham radio repeater, known as WA7FFM is located on the mountain as well.
==Observatory==
West Mountain Observatory
West Mountain Observatory, which is operated by nearby BYU, is located just southwest of the north summit of West Mountain. It was constructed for the astronomy department of BYU in 1981 and houses three telescopes.
==Access==
West Mountain road, which leads to the north summit, begins on Lincoln Beach road, directly northeast of the north summit. It is a winding road, which may or may not be in good condition, depending on the season. Those wishing to access the mountain are suggested to use four wheel drive vehicles.

The set was written by Ed Greenwood and published by TSR. It featured box cover art by Brom. and was published in 1991.
==Contents==
The set consists of a 128-page booklet titled 'Campaign Guide to Undermountain', a 32-page booklet titled 'Undermountain Adventures', 8 double-sided loose-leaf monster statistics pages, 8 double-sided heavy-stock "adventure aid" cards, and 4 color fold-out poster maps.
It uses the same Brom cover art as the box cover itself, with interior art by Karl Waller and cartography by Diesel, Steve Beck, and David Sutherland. This book contains detailed information on the dungeon Undermountain, including non-player characters (such as Halaster Blackcloak) that can be encountered within the dungeons or in the city above it, as well as spells and magic items that can be found. The book also keys the maps to what can be found in various locations and contains expansion guidelines for creating future adventures and deeper parts of the dungeon.
The set provides the "first three levels of the original dungeon of Undermountain, beneath the city of Waterdeep". The entire Ruins of Undermountain is purported to be the "deepest dungeon of them all" with nine levels and fourteen sub-levels. It contains two books describing the Undermountain complex. The larger is the 'Campaign Guide to Undermountain'. It includes Undermountain history and other related information. The second book contains adventures, monster descriptions, maps, and other products.
There are over 350 rooms per level, but not all are detailed: "even with approximately 25 areas of interest on the first level, 26 on the second level and none on the third, a remarkably high percentage of rooms are left completely undetailed".
The 'Undermountain Adventures' booklet describes seven adventures designed to be used within Undermountain, but can be used in any dungeon. The booklet also contains a "Monster Guide" of statblocks and descriptions of monsters not otherwise featured in the boxed set, and a description of the city of Skullport. The booklet has a detached cover, with cover art by Jeff Easley, and maps of some of the encounters on the inside, with cartography by David Sutherland.
The monster sheets detail 11 monsters in the Monstrous Compendium style: elder orb beholder, death kiss beholder-kin, darktentacles, ibrandlin, scaladar, sharn, slithermorph, flying snakes (flying fang and deathfang), steel shadow, and watchghost.
The cards are adventure aids for the Dungeon Master, detailing traps, encounters, treasure, and sundries that can be placed in the midst of adventures.
The maps detail the first three levels of the ruins of Undermountain; level three takes up two of the maps.
==Publication history==
Shannon Appelcline commented that "'The Ruins of Undermountain' (1991), located under the City of Waterdeep, was one of the first real "mega" dungeons — though it trailed Greyhawk's own offering, 'Greyhawk Ruins', by a year."
==Reception==
The adventure was ranked the 17th greatest adventure of all time by 'Dungeon' magazine for the 30th anniversary of the 'Dungeons & Dragons' game in 2004. 
Keith Eisenbeis reviewed the module in the February 1992 issue of 'White Wolf Magazine'. He noted the appearance of the product materials, especially the maps, as exceptional, but the remainder of lesser quality. Overall, he rated the product a 3 out of a possible 5.

==References==Location of Jos in Nigeria
The '2001 Jos riots' were riots involving Christians and Muslims in Jos, Nigeria, over the appointment of a Muslim politician, Alhaji Muktar Mohammed, as local coordinator of the federal poverty alleviation program. The clashes started on 7 September and lasted nearly two weeks, ending on 17 September. Some 1,000 people were killed during the riots. 
==Causes==
Religious and ethnic conflicts have repeatedly occurred in Jos due to the city's geographical placement in Nigeria. Jos, the capital of Plateau State, is located in the middle of the country, which lies between the predominantly Muslim north and the predominantly Christian south. Jos was also known for its job opportunities leading people from around Nigeria to move there for employment. The influx of people led to tensions between members of "indigene" (indigenous) ethnic groups and non-indigene ethnic groups (often referred to as "settlers"). In June 2001 the federal government appointed a Hausa Muslim politician, Alhaji Muktar Mohammed, as local coordinator of the federal poverty alleviation program, leading indigene Christians to protest his appointment. Tensions turned violent on 7 September 2001, when a Christian woman attempted to cross a barricaded street outside a mosque during Friday prayers. It led to a conflict between her and a group of Muslims. The fight eventually spread to other parts of the city.
==Riots==
Fighting spread through various Jos neighborhoods and to surrounding communities. Property and even human beings were set on fire. Many houses, shops, mosques and churches were burned or damaged. Torched cars were left along the streets after the clashes.  Christian leaders reported that Muslims spontaneously attacked Christians and burned churches, including three churches of the Church of Christ in Nigeria (presently known as, 'Church of Christ in Nations' COCIN), the main Assemblies of God church, and a Jos Apostolic Church. The military was eventually deployed and stopped the violence. Local sources said the military's intervention and strict enforcement of the curfew helped end the clashes.
==Aftermath==
A hospitalized gunshot victim (left) from the 2001 Jos Riots
The 10 days of violence left approximately 1,000 dead. Because of the large number of people killed in the clashes, a mass burial had to be arranged. The riots caused the displacement of at least 50,000 civilians. The authorities arrested several hundred people and set up a commission of inquiry, which identified people who were allegedly involved in the violence, but no one was successfully prosecuted.

==References=='Jonathan Joseph "Mandy" Brooks', (born Jonathan Joseph Brozek) (August 18, 1897 – December 6, 1976) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder for the Chicago Cubs.
==Baseball career==
Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Brooks began his professional baseball career in 1924 with the Columbus Senators of the Tri-State League where he had 195 hits in 145 games for a .342 batting average.
His major-league debut came at the relatively advanced age of 27 on May 30, 1925. He reached 25 career RBI in 17 games, the fewest games for any major league player since the statistic came into existence in 1920, as per the Elias Sports Bureau. In his first 25 major league games he posted a .398 batting average along with 32 runs batted in and a 1.246 on-base plus slugging percentage.
Brooks went on to be a regular for the Cubs that season, playing the second-most games of any outfielder. Every one of his defensive appearances came in center field. It was a rather successful rookie campaign; Brooks trailed only future Hall of Fame member Gabby Hartnett for the club's lead in home runs with 14, good enough to finish tenth in the entire National League in that category. Brooks was also second on the Cubs in runs batted in (72) and slugging percentage (.513). He finished his first season with a respectable .281 batting average.
Brooks, however, fell victim to the Cubs' acquisition of star outfielder Hack Wilson and found himself all but useless in the 1926 season. He played his final game for the Cubs on June 22 of that year, finishing his final big-league campaign with modest marks of 1 home run, a .188 batting average, and 6 RBI. Brooks returned to the minor leagues where he played for a number of teams before retiring in 1931 at the age of 33.
==Career statistics==
In a two-year major league career, Brooks played in 116 games, accumulating 107 hits in 397 at bats for a .270 career batting average along with 15 home runs, 78 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .316. His career fielding percentage of .979 was higher than the league average of .967. In eight minor league seasons, Brooks had a .300 career batting average.
==Death==
Brooks died on December 6, 1976 in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.

'Lionel Tardy' (born June 7, 1966 in Annecy-le-Vieux, Haute-Savoie) is a member of the National Assembly of France.  He represents the Haute-Savoie department, and is a member of the Union for a Popular Movement.
==Career==
He is a computer scientist by profession, Lionel Tardy is manager of the company services and computer consulting LTI (Lionel Tardy Computer). It employs 18 people and specializes in the sale of complete IT solutions to SMEs in the Savoy. He became vice president of the service sector of the CGPME of Haute-Savoie, and President from November 2005 to January 2007.
He resigned to run for the 2007 French legislative election. Although new to politics, he was elected on 17 June 2007, for the XIIIth legislature (2007–2012), in the second district of Haute-Savoie, beating the second round, the incumbent Bernard Bosson (New Centre) with 55.51% of the vote. He is committed to Cumul des mandats. His election against a leading political figure can be explained by the informal support he enjoyed from many elected officials of the UMP, opposed to Mr. Bosson for his support of Nicolas Sarkozy during the presidential election.
Although labeled "a member of the right", however he sits in the UMP, in the National Assembly. He is a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Vice President of SMB. He noted the 18 October 2007, during the budget debate in 2008, by an amendment to the heads of SMEs to reduce their ISF up to the amounts they invest for five years in society. This provision has raised some concerns in the ranks of the left, and among the UMP. He is Chairman of the Working Group on payment periods in the context of the law on the modernization of the economy.
In 2009, during discussions on the Creation and Internet law (HADOPI law), he was the member for the Presidential Majority, investing most actively against the principle of flexible response, with technical and legal arguments, both in the chamber and the media. Part of the arguments were taken up by the Constitutional Council, in the revision of the law. He opposed the revised bill. In 2011, he proposed a "freedom of panorama" amendment, which was defeated.
On 30 June  2010, he took part in the hearing of Raymond Domenech by Parliament about the World Cup in South Africa. Opposed to the hearing in camera, Lionel Tardy transcribed the remarks via Twitter.
On 14 July 2011, Lionel Tardy told the Green Party candidate to the presidential election Eva Joly, who has the French and Norwegian double nationality, to go back to Norway.

Fossils of euzaphlegids are found from Paleocene to Late Miocene-aged marine strata of Europe, the Caucasus Mountains, India, Iran, Turkmenistan, Italy, and Southern California.
==Description and taxonomy==
In life, the Euzaphlegidae would have borne a superficial resemblance to mackerels or wahoo, leading some researchers to place them within the Scombridae or Cybiidae, respectively. However, X-ray analysis of the bone structure strongly suggests a relationship with the snake-mackerels, with some experts placing them within the Gempylidae.
==Ecology and anatomy==
The sharp teeth and mackerel-like forms strongly suggest that the euzaphlegids were predators, verified by the remains of numerous extinct deep sea smelt, 'Bathylagus', and herring, 'Xyne grex', found within the stomachs of several specimens of 'Thyrsocles' and 'Euzaphleges'.  Researcher Lore Rose David proposed that, because the Euzaphlegidae were comparatively less adapted to a pelagic lifestyle like the gempylids, but had slender skeletons suggesting of a deep-water lifestyle, the Euzaphlegidae lived in deep, offshore communities near the ocean floor, where they preyed on other fish.  David also suggested that the Euzaphlegidae presence in Miocene California excluded the gempylids from establishing themselves there at the time, while the presence of scombrids in shallower water ecosystems prevented the Euzaphlegidae from establishing themselves in shallow water.
==Taxonomy==
Originally, the family Euzaphlegidae (synonym=Zaphlegidae) originally described containing only the three to four genera from Late Miocene Southern California strata.  Later, the genus 'Palimphyes', whose 10 species are found in Paleogene Tethys and Paratethys strata from the Swiss Alps, the Carpathians, Caucasus, Iran, India and Turkmenistan, was placed within Euzaphlegidae as the subfamily Dipterichthyinae (named after a junior synonym, 'Dipterichthys').  Recently, a new genus, 'Veronaphleges', was found and described from Monte Bolca, representing one of the very few mesopelagic fish known from that lagerstätte.  'Veronaphleges' apparently is a basal form that can not be grouped in either subfamily.
==Extinction==
The family originates in the Paratethys during the Paleocene, and becomes widespread throughout the Tethys and Paratethys Oceans, until the Late Oligocene, when the genus 'Palimphyes' disappears from the fossil record.  Euzaphlegids would survive in deep water habitats of what is now Southern California, where they became mesopelagic predators ecologically similar to their relatives, the snake mackerels and escolars.
During the time of the Late Miocene, Southern California had a very warm, tropical climate.  The transition from Late Miocene to Early Pliocene saw the climate cool, and this cooling event drove the surviving Euzaphlegidae and several other (locally) endemic fish species, such as the manefish 'Chalcidichthys' and the spinyfin 'Absalomichthys', into extinction.  This cooling event, coupled with the survival of the scombrids in southern Californian marine ecosystems, also helped prevent gempylids from replacing the Euzaphlegidae during the Pliocene or Pleistocene.

No further edits should be made to this page.The 'Fouad Shehab Command and Staff College' ('CSC') (  'Kouliyat Fouad Chehab lelkiyada' wal'arkan') is a Lebanese Armed Forces facility that functions as a graduate school for the Lebanese Army in addition to other Arab armies. It was originally established in 1974 as the 'Center of Higher Military Education'. The college is named after the former Lebanese Army commander-in-chief and former Lebanese president Fuad Chehab.
==History==
The LAF CSC was founded on September 1, 1974 under the name 'Center of Higher Military Education' and headquartered at the LAF headquarters in Yarze, it was later renamed on January 24, 1980 into 'College of Higher Military Education', ultimately it was called 'Command & Staff College' on August 18, 1983 and headquartered since then at the town of Rihania.
As of October 10, 2005, the name of General Fuad Chehab was added to the name of the college as way to honor him.
==Mission==
The LAF CSC prepares officers of different arms to exercise command over tactical, logistic units or administration services. It also prepares officers to fulfill staff function at different levels. Moreover, it organizes training periods for acquisition of staff techniques. The CSC also increases the officers' ability to better fulfill their missions by deepening their knowledge through studies and researches. In addition, the college carries out researches, in favor of the army command, into some subjects of military strategy that might interest the national defense.
==Courses==
The initial training is three years at the Military Academy, on the third year an application course takes place, for some officers this course is followed abroad. The higher courses are taken after the initial training, depending on the track of each individual:
# 'Captains’ course:' obligatory trainings for 3 months.
# 'Battalion Commander course:' obligatory trainings for 4 months followed in the CSC.
# 'Staff course:' selection based on competitive examination, lasts for 11 months and is followed in the CSC.
==Applications==
The college employs Janus tactical simulator in its courses, which was officially ready for use in 2006. The simulator is used
to train the major units' staff commanders and the officers enrolled for battalion commander and staff courses in the CSC, for fields skills and up to Brigade level command. This is done by making simulations on various changing tactical combat conditions, and experience them on assessing the combat situation under various realistic and pressuring conditions, while taking into account the practical application of the staff theories, techniques, and knowledge. In addition to conducting training on decision making and giving orders at the right time in the right place for the commanded units.
==Emblem==
Each symbol on the emblem of the Command and Staff College represents a specific ideal for a member of the Army:
* 'Two spread Swords:' Symbol of the officer’s command
* 'Two palms:' Eternal vitality and generosity
* 'The Cedar:' symbol of Lebanon: in all circumstances, it remains green and at the top for good
* 'The Flaming torch:' Symbol of sacrifice and martyr

==Biography==
Kevorkov was born in Shamakhi to an Armenian family. He was appointed Secretary of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast in 1973, the middle of the Brezhnev era. His predecessor Gurgen Melkumyan was removed after leader of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR Heydar Aliyev came into conflict with the Armenian leadership of the autonomous oblast. Melkumyan was a native of Nagorno-Karabakh, unlike Kevorkov.
Although an Armenian, Kevorkov was very loyal to Aliyev and other Azerbaijani leaders in Baku, and was resented by the Armenian community. He was married to an Azerbaijani woman. Kevorkov reportedly never once visited Armenia during his fourteen years in the post.
During the Karabakh movement, 87 Armenian deputies from the Regional Soviet called an emergency session of the assembly on 20 February 1988 in response to Armenian demonstrations in Stepanakert calling for the unification of Karabakh and Armenia. Kevorkov and First Secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist Party Kamran Baghirov tried and failed to stop the session from taking place. Late in the evening, 110 Armenian deputies voted unanimously for the resolution, calling for Nagorno-Karabakh to join Soviet Armenia. The Azerbaijani deputies refused to vote. Kevorkov tried to steal the stamp needed to confirm the resolution.
On 24 February 1988, Kevorkov was removed from office by Moscow emissaries. His deputy, Genrikh Poghosyan, who was much more popular among Armenians, took his place.
==Last years==
As the First Nagorno-Karabakh War intensified, Kevorkov decided to move to Moscow, but was arrested at the airport by the Azerbaijani authorities on May 24, 1992. Kevorkov was released from a Baku jail in 1993 by the decree of President Heydar Aliyev. He subsequently settled in Moscow and worked as a middle school history teacher. He died there in December 1998.

The property has commanding views of the city and the James River.  Its name originated due to the land on which it is built being used as a clandestine dueling ground.
==History==
Its builder and designer, Dr. George Cabell, was a friend of Thomas Jefferson, and physician to Patrick Henry. Before building the house, he purchased 856 acres of land including Daniel's Island, Treasure Island and Woodruff Island from Lewellen Jones, who had bought it from Christopher Lynch, son of Quaker patriot Charles Lynch (1736–1796) and nephew of John Lynch, who started the ferry for which the city is named.
After Cabell died of complications after falling off a horse in 1823, and his widow died three years later, it passed to William Lewis Cabell, who may have leased it to the Langhorne family (as discussed below), before he and his wife Eliza Daniel died of tuberculosis in 1830. It was inherited by her father, Judge William Daniel (delegate to the Virginia general assembly 1798–1799). When he too died in 1839, it passed to his son William Daniel Jr. (Eliza's brother and also the father of United States Senator John Warwick Daniel, "the Lame Lion of Lynchburg.")
David P. Payne bought the house in two acres of land in 1848, and in 1857 sold it back to Daniel, who sold it to Colonel Robert L. Owen Sr., who was President of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, and whose son Robert Latham Owen Jr. later became a United States Senator. Owen ran the railroad during the American Civil War, and became a state senator immediately afterward, but resigned his post because he opposed consolidating this railroad with others acquired by William Mahone. Owen died a financially ruined man in 1873, the same year the merged railroad went bankrupt, and the family mansion again changed hands.
At two different times in the 19th century, members of the Langhorne family owned Point of Honor. Henry Langhorne, who owned the Langhorne Mills in Lynchburg, purchased it in 1828. Later, but still before the war, John S. Langhorne held the residence. His eldest son Chiswell Langhorne became a wealthy industrialist, and daughter Elizabeth Langhorne Lewis was a prominent suffragette. John S. Langhorne's granddaughters included Mrs. Charles Dana Gibson (the original 'Gibson Girl'), and Nancy Langhorne, Viscountess Lady Astor (the first woman elected to the British Parliament).
By 1878 it was owned by L.E. Lichford, a grocery wholesaler who also had a warehouse nearby. Three generations of the family owned the property, during which time the surrounding area developed. James R. Gilliam Jr. bought the house in 1928 and deeded it to the City of Lynchburg, which used part of the property as a recreation center until the Historical Foundation received the deed in 1968.
==Architecture==
The irregularly shaped two-story Federal mansion is built of stuccoed brick. The facade is composed of a three-bay center section flanked by two octagonal ended projections. Construction was started in 1806, and completed in 1815. It was renovated about two decades later, with wallpaper and stucco added, and perhaps a porch which was removed during the 1977 restoration.
It bears a strong relationship to the Hancock-Wirt-Caskie House in Richmond, Virginia.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and opened as a public museum in 1978.

==Background==
In 1979, Haggard joined Charlie Daniels and Ernest Tubb on a remake of Tubb's "Walking the Floor Over You," which became a minor hit that fall, and on 'The Way I Am' Haggard pays further tribute to the Texas legend by covering three more of his songs: "Take Me Back and Try Me One More Time," "I'll Always Be Glad to Take You Back," and "It's Been So Long, Darlin'." It also features a rendition of Floyd Tillman's classic statement of romantic fatalism, "It Makes No Difference Now."  The LP's hit single was the Sonny Throckmorton-penned title track, which reached #2 on the 'Billboard' country singles chart. Haggard, who wrote nearly all of his previous album 'Serving 190 Proof',  provides only four original compositions here, with David Cantwell commenting in his 2013 Haggard biography 'The Running Kind', "Merle's songwriting ran hot and cold during his MCA tenure, but his vocals were always nuanced and hauntingly melodic..." The album was produced by Haggard's longtime manager Fuzzy Owen, fellow country star Porter Wagoner, and Don Gant, who had also worked with Haggard's hero Lefty Frizzell.
After recording this album, Haggard would score his first #1 hit since 1976's "Cherokee Maiden"  with "Bar Room Buddies," a duet he recorded with actor Clint Eastwood for the soundtrack to the film 'Any Which Way You Can'.
==Reception==
The LP was released in April 1980 and peaked at number 16 on the 'Billboard' country album charts.
AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes 'The Way I Am' as "pretty much a straight-ahead honky tonk album that pays little mind to the contemporary trends of the day. Where it differs from 'Serving 190 Proof' or 'Back to the Barrooms' is that the performances are a little inconsistent, as is the material." Music critic Robert Christgau wrote "... Haggard's chief value has been vocal ever since "Okie From Muskogee" saddled him with an image, and here his resonant, reflective baritone transforms three Ernest Tubb tunes from standards into timeless pieces of Americana."

===Early career===
Doug Yates grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, the hub for NASCAR. He graduated from North Carolina State University in 1990 with a degree in mechanical engineering and in 2015 was inducted into the NC State MAE (Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering) Hall of Fame. Yates worked in his father's race shop, Robert Yates Racing, in between semesters, then joined the organization full time in 1990 as the team's engine builder.

Yates engines won at various tracks including Daytona International Speedway and Indianapolis Motor Speedway and won the 1999 NASCAR Winston Cup Series Championship with driver Dale Jarrett. In total, Yates won 56 races and three championships with Robert Yates Racing.
===Roush Yates Engines Established===
In 2003, with the support from Ford, the Robert and Doug Yates merged their engine departments with their rival Jack Roush of Roush Racing (now Roush Fenway Racing) to form what is now  'Roush Yates Engines', with Doug Yates becoming CEO and President. Roush Yates Engines is the exclusive Ford engine builder for NASCAR and builds over 900 engines annually in their 75,000 square-foot facility in Mooresville, North Carolina. Doug's father, Robert, retired from racing at the end of 2007, allowing Doug the opportunity to become the team owner of Yates Racing. Yates fielded a car for drivers David Gilliland, Travis Kvapil, Paul Menard and Bobby Labonte. Yates started 'Roush Yates Performance Parts' in 2008, an outlet for new and used engine and chassis parts.

* Yates Racing Owner Statistics'Daifallah Bouramiya' is a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the fourth district. Born in 1957, Bouramiya studied public health and worked in as a doctor before being elected to the National Assembly in 2003.  He is an independent deputy.
==Removing Health Minister Al-Jarallah==
On April 4, 2005, Bouramiya grilled Health Minister Mohammad Al-Jarallah over alleged mismanagement, leading the minister to resign two days later.  As party of the grilling, Bouramiya read out a long list of accusations, including deterioration of health services and squandering of public funds in medical purchases and hospital rehabilitation projects.  The minister resigned before he could be brought before a no-confidence vote, which was to be led by Bouramiya and ten other MPs.  Some newspapers alleged that the MPs behind the motion were upset that no member of the powerful Awazem tribe or Shiite had been named minister in recent Cabinet changes.
==Resignation of Oil Minister Bader Mishari al-Humaidhi==
After Al-Humaidhi was appointed oil minister in the October 28, 2007, cabinet shuffle, Bouramiya and Musallam AlـBarrak wanted to question him about failing to curb consumer debts and embezzlement in state investments abroad during his time as finance minister. The prime minister preempted the parliamentary grilling and angered lawmakers who accused him of covering up corruption and undermining their constitutional right to question ministers.
The political standoff reached unprecedented levels when the prime minister and the speaker of the house, Jassem Al-Kharafi, exchanged criticism and accusations in a television interview and a statement published in the country's newspapers.
==Opposed Guaranteeing Bank Deposits==
On October 28, 2008, the parliament voted 50-7 to insure all types of deposits in all local banks within Kuwait.  Bouramiya opposed the bill, along with Jabir Al-Azmi, Hussein AlـQallaf Al-Bahraini, Mohammed Al-Obaid, Mohammed Hayef AlـMutairi, Musallam AlـBarrak, and Waleed AlـTabtabaie.  Bouramiya accused the Cabinet of speeding up the bill's passage for the benefit of monetary tycoons.
==Advanced Treatment Hospital==
On January 1, 2009, Bouramiya submitted a draft law to set up a specialty hospital to treat Kuwaiti citizens who require advanced medical treatment. The document states that a separate hospital to treat critical cases be built and suggests that government own 50 percent shares while the rest be open for public subscription.
==Walk-Out Protest Against Cabinet==
On January 13, 2009, Bouramiya and ten other MPs walked out of the year's first session complaining of a lack of new faces in the new cabinet.
==References==The 'Kingston Arms Apartments' is an apartment building located at 296 East Grand Boulevard in Detroit, Michigan, in the East Grand Boulevard Historic District. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The Kingston Arms, built in 1924, is a representative example of the rise of middle-class apartment buildings in pre-Depression era Detroit.
==Description==
The Kingston Arms is a -story apartment building with 24 apartments. The building is rectangular in plan with a front façade facing East Grand Boulevard and a longer façade facing the side street. Retail space with a separate entrance is located in the basement.
The facade is predominantly brick, trimmed with stone around windows, at the building base, and at the parapet. The upper two floors have recessed half timbers inset in projecting bays, with gables above. The original entrance doors and windows are still in place. Other than paint, the facades have received no alterations since they were constructed.
The interior of the building has a lobby with wainscoting and a high ceiling. Ceramic tiles in the lobby appear to include Pewabic tiles laid in an unusual diagonal pattern.

==History==
A building permit was initially issued to Albert A. Rose for the Kingston Arms in 1916; however, due to a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the land, construction of the building was delayed until 1924. Construction took place during 1924-25. The building remained in Rose's hands through the Great Depression, but ownership changed in about 1937. The building has remained as apartments throughout its life. It is currently owned by Messiah Housing Corporation, which purchase the building in 1990 and refurbished twice since then. Messiah Housing also owns the nearby Saint Paul Manor Apartments and El Tovar Apartments.

==Baseball career==
Brown, a Grambling State University product, was drafted three times by major league teams (including the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates) before finally signing with the Cubs on June 20, 1966. He made his only major league appearance on September 21, 1968 against Pittsburgh at Forbes Field. Brown relieved Bobby Tiefenauer, who had in turn relieved the Cubs' starter that day, Joe Niekro. He allowed one run in two innings of work, memorably retiring opposing pitcher Dock Ellis on a line drive back to the mound for the final out of his debut. Brown was removed for pinch-hitter Clarence Jones in the next inning. He would never pitch in the majors again.
==Acting career==
Brown's first television role was uncredited as a police officer on a 1964 episode of 'Arrest and Trial', titled "The Black Flower." He first worked as a stunt man the next year on episodes of 'I Spy'. Brown also played an uncredited role as a reporter on a 1965 'I Spy' episode, "So Long, Patrick Henry."
His next work in Hollywood didn't come until 1973 in 'Coffy', when Brown played uncredited roles as both a party guest and a stunt man. That began a 35-year career during which he acted in 35 films and did stunts in 115. Brown worked in as many as seven movies in a year.
Recognition came in the form of a World Stunt Award for Best Work with a Vehicle. He shared the award with nine others for a car-chase scene in 'Bad Boys II'. Brown also was nominated with six others for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture in "Wanted". That 2008 film was the last in which he worked.
Other career highlights included working as a stunt double for Morgan Freeman in three films: 'Along Came a Spider' (2001), 'The Sum of All Fears' (2002) and 'Dreamcatcher' (2003). Brown was the stunt coordinator on seven motion pictures: 'The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings' (1975), 'Scarface' (1983), 'Action Jackson' and 'Miracle at Beekman's Place' (1988), 'Graffiti Bridge' (1990), 'House Party 3' (1994), 'Sudden Death' (1995), 'Sometimes They Come Back... Again' (1996) and 'The Relic' (1997). He also played the gatekeeper in 'Jurassic Park'.
His baseball background was helpful for 'Bingo Long,' in which he worked both as stunt coordinator and in the role of All-Stars third baseman Emory "Champ" Chambers.
Brown's last acting role was an uncredited part as a chef in 'Spider-Man' (2002).
== Death ==
Jophery Brown died on January 11, 2014 at the age of 68 just 11 days short of his 69th birthday from complications related to a cancer treatment.

==References=='Maryse Joissains-Masini' (born 15 August 1942), also known as Maryse Charton, is the mayor of Aix-en-Provence. She was also a member of the National Assembly of France. in which she represented the Bouches-du-Rhône department, and is a member of The Republicans party.
==Biography==
===Early life===
Maryse Charton was born 15 August 1942 in Toulon, France. Her parents were both Communists, and her father was Maurice Thorez's bodyguard. She worked for the Social Security in France and volunteered as a young communist. She then received a BA degree from the University of the South, Toulon-Var followed by a master's degree and a PhD from Aix-Marseille University.
===Career===
She subsequently taught criminology and private law at Aix-Marseille University. In 1968, she married Alain Joissains. In 1970, she started her career as a lawyer. She worked in the cases of the Infected blood scandal and the use of asbestos. It was also then that she became a follower of Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber and joined the Radical Party.
From 1983 to 1989, she was a member of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. She has been the Mayor of Aix-en-Provence since 2001. She signed a law criminalizing drunkenness in public, a move aimed at the area's homeless people. In 2009, her re-election was invalidated by a former councilor, Stéphane Salord, under the assumption that allegations spread about her opponent François-Xavier de Peretti were too personal and violent. Nevertheless, she was re–elected. In June 2011, she voted against same-sex marriage. She has been accused of not attending the sessions in the National Assembly of France. However, she responded by saying she was in attendance once a month. She is among the French politicians who hold the most elected positions at different levels of government. She is a recipient of the Legion of Honour.
Shortly after François Hollande was elected president in 2012, she suggested that he might be "illegitimate", arguing that the entire French media and labor unions supported him and unfairly criticized Nicolas Sarkozy's tenure, and she asked the Constitutional Council of France to annul the election results; however, she was rebuffed.
===Personal life===
Her former husband, Alain Joissains, was the mayor of Aix-en-Provence from 1978 to 1983. Now divorced, their daughter Sophie Joissains is a member of the French Senate.

He is backed by Norm Hamlet and Don Markham of The Strangers.
==Background==
As the title suggests, 'Back to the Barrooms' features some of Haggard's hardest drinking songs since his early honky-tonk classics "Swinging Doors" and "The Bottle Let Me Down." "I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink," his only solo #1 hit at MCA, features an extended jam unusual for a country single at the time, consisting of Larry Muhobarec on piano, Don Markham on saxophone, and Reggie Young on guitar. The self-explanatory "I Don't Want To Sober Up Tonight" and the title track are also unabashed odes to getting drunk. The single "Misery and Gin" had appeared on the soundtrack to the film 'Bronco Billy', in which Haggard had a cameo role, appearing as himself.  A music video was also made for the song.
"Leonard" is Haggard's tribute to his friend and mentor Tommy Collins. Haggard had been recording songs written by Collins throughout his career, beginning with the novelty "Sam Hill" in 1964 and scoring a #1 single with "Carolyn" in 1971. Collins, who had never heard the song, was in the studio the day Haggard cut it and, as he tells Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 box set 'Down Every Road', he was overwhelmed: "It's hard to describe how you feel when you first fall in love, it's hard to explain how you feel when you become the father of a child. It's one of those things it's hard to explain. I was very honored, and very humbled by the fact that he did that." The song became a Top 10 hit.
Other notable tracks include "(I Don't Have) Any More Love Songs", which is a Hank Williams, Jr. song from his 1979 'Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound', and "Can't Break the Habit," a song co-authored by Haggard and his third wife Leona Williams. Haggard and Williams, who married in 1978, began having troubles around this time and their divorce would begin Haggard's long descent into alcoholism and cocaine addiction.
"Easy Come, Easy Go" is a cover of a song by The Sutherland Brothers from their 1979 album, 'When the Night Comes Down'.
==Reception==
The LP was released in October 1980 and reached number 8 on the Billboard country albums chart. Thom Jurek of AllMusic insists that 'Back to the Barrooms' "is really about is the wreckage caused by broken amorous relationships and boozy escape as the only way to cope." Calling it his strongest album on MCA, Jurek compliments Jimmy Bowen's "progressive country style" and calls it Haggard's "most consistent, inspiring performance since he left Capitol, and was the beginning of a creative renaissance, though the personal toll it took on him would prove considerable."

==References==The '1970–71 season' was 'Cardiff City F.C.'s 44th season in the Football League. They competed in the 22-team Division Two, then the second tier of English football, finishing third.
The club's season was disrupted by the sale of John Toshack to Liverpool in November, breaking up the Toshack-Brian Clark strike partnership which had scored countless goals for the club in recent years. Despite this the team reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners Cup before losing 2–1 on aggregate to Spanish side Real Madrid, after winning the first leg 1–0 at their home ground Ninian Park, a result that has since gone on to become one of the most famous moments in the club's history.

He is best known for his time racing in the British Touring Car Championship in the mid-nineties.
==Racing career==
===Early years===
Brookes was born in Walsall and started racing in karting. He was the Senior British Champion in 1990. In 1993 he raced in the Renault Elf oils Clio Challenge, finishing fourth on points in his first season. After finishing third in 1994, he became champion in 1995.

===BTCC===
In 1996 he entered the prestigious British Touring Car Championship, in an ex-works Toyota Carina. He won the Total Cup For Privateers with the TOM'S Team Brookes, ran by his father Jon. Although running as an independent driver, Brookes did have limited works backing from Toyota. In 1997 he replaced the car with a Peugeot 406 that had been used by the Peugeot works team the previous year. The car suffered reliability problems that he hadn't had with the previous years car. He finished second in the independents cup, narrowly losing out to Robb Gravett. He teamed up with Gravett a year later, Brookes Motorsport entered one Honda Accord for Gravett. Brookes himself raced in just two rounds at Oulton Park. The two drivers also entered the Bathurst 1000 that year. Brookes drove the Honda Accord for a part season in 1999, finishing fourth in the independents cup.
Brookes Motorsport reformed as TCR, which still runs on the TOCA support package, with some success.

Team colours are red shirt, black shorts and socks. 
==History==
'Club de Fútbol La Nucía' rose from the ashes of several teams that were successively created in the city, receiving this denomination in 1995. In 1998–99, the club promoted to the first regional division for the first time, returning again to that level five years later.
The 2006–07 season was full of unexpected events. After qualifying to the promotion playoffs for Tercera División, La Nucía was eliminated by CD Olímpic de Xàtiva (1–1 draw in the first leg and 0–1 loss in the second). During the summer, however, 'Club de Fútbol Dolores' forfeited its berth in the competition, with La Nucía occupying its place, with a first-ever promotion to the national categories.
In its first season in the fourth division, La Nucía finished in third position in the regular season, thus qualifying for the promotion playoffs, being eliminated by UD Las Palmas Atlético (1–1 at home, 1–2 away loss). The team met the same fate in the following campaign, being ousted by RSD Alcalá in the third round (0–2 on aggregate).
On 30 June 2019, La Nucía achieved their first promotion ever to the third division after beating Linares in the last round of the promotion playoffs, with a latest goal in the 93rd minute. It was scored by San Julían, who gave the historic promotion to the club in the last game of his entire career.

* Club & stadium history'Balmorhea State Park' is a  state park located on the San Solomon Springs in Reeves County, Texas, opened in 1968. The closest city is Balmorhea, Texas. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department manages the park. The park is open year-round, and visitation is capped at 900 people per day.
==Features==
The main feature of the park is the ,  freshwater pool built around the springs. It is the world’s largest spring-fed swimming pool. The spring has a constant flow of 22 to  a day so no chlorination is required. The water temperature ranges from  and up to  deep.  The pool bottom is flat in the more shallow areas and has a more natural rock bottom in the deeper areas. The pool is used for both swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving.
==History==
The Texas State Parks Board bought San Solomon Springs and the surrounding land in 1934. Company 1856 of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built the pool between 1936 and 1941 as part of the New Deal during the Great Depression as a way to open up jobs for people needing work. The CCC also built San Solomon Springs Courts, which rents rooms available for overnight stays. Camping and recreational vehicle sites are also available. A private concessionaire operated the facility until 1968, when the Parks and Wildlife Department took over management, and it became part of the state parks system.
The Balmorhea State Park Cienega Project, started in 1995, recreated a desert wetland in the park. The original cienega was lost when the CCC channeled water from the springs in to the pool. The cienega now serves as a habitat for endangered fish such as the Comanche Springs pupfish and Pecos gambusia as well as other aquatic life, birds and other animals.
In early 2018, a wall in the pool around the diving board collapsed, and the pool was shut down. Houston-based Apache Corporation pledged to match all donations made to repair the pool up to one million dollars. The goal was reached in about four months. Sixty percent of the donations were under $100, however, other Texas companies made significant contributions, including Saulsbury Industries, Texas Pacific Land Trust, McCoy Remme Ranches, Legend Energy Services, Pioneer Energy Services and Garrison Brothers Distillery. Apache Corporation also established a one million dollar endowment fund for the park.
The pool reopened March 1, 2019 after repairs to the pool were completed. Only day-use facilities were available while the renovation of San Solomon Courts and campgrounds were still under way.
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department shut the park again on September 3, 2019 to repair the park's failing septic system  and again in January 2021 for further repairs "for the foreseeable future."

His published work is sometimes attributed under the names 'Fitz Stewart' or 'Colonel Blacker'.
==Life and career==
Born in Carrickblacker House, in the Oneilland East barony in County Armagh, he entered the University of Dublin in the 1790s. Blacker was a participant at the Battle of the Diamond. There, Blacker became one of the original members of the Orange Institution. After earning his degree, Blacker obtained a commission in the 60th Regiment of Foot, then serving in the West Indies, but poor health compelled him to return home. In 1806 he was promoted to major, and in 1812 rose to his final rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1816 his uncle Sir George Hill, 2nd Baronet appointed Blacker to the Commission of the Treasury of Ireland. He was confirmed Lord Dublin and was the great grandfather of Sir Cecil Blacker Commandant of Horse.
In 1829, he inherited the family estate upon his father's death. He resigned his military office shortly after and retired to Carrickblacker House. Blacker was buried in Portadown in the Old Seagoe Cemetery.
===Writings===
Blacker and his relative Valentine Blacker were both lieutenant-colonels, and both were published authors. Because some of the work was published pseudonymously, the two are sometimes confused or conflated in texts.  In 'The Dublin University Magazine', where his work often appeared, they wrote,  "We know not why Colonel Blacker has chosen not to own himself the author of some papers which in the pages of our own Magazine have excited attention of which any man might feel proud."
Blacker authored a popular poem on military service, 'Oliver's Advice', originally published in 1834 under his occasional pseudonym, "Fitz Stewart." The poem was widely anthologized. The poem popularized a phrase attributed to Oliver Cromwell as part of a "well-authenticated anecdote." Each stanza ends with a variant of the line, "put your trust in God, my boys, and keep your powder dry." The line appeared in 'Bartlett's Familiar Quotations' attributed to Colonel Blacker.
His 1818 song "The Crimson Banner" commemorates the Siege of Derry during the Williamite War in Ireland.

==References==The 'Global Network Initiative' ('GNI') is a non-governmental organization with the dual goals of preventing Internet censorship by authoritarian governments and protecting the Internet privacy rights of individuals. It is sponsored by a coalition of multinational corporations, non-profit organizations, and universities.
==History==
On October 29, 2008, the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles of Freedom of Expression and Privacy".  The Initiative was launched in the 60th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights on freedom of expression and privacy set out in the UDHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).
==Profile==
As a human rights organization, GNI seeks to safeguard freedom of expression and personal privacy against government restrictions. The protections are facilitated by a coalition of companies, investors, civil society organizations, academics, and other stakeholders.
GNI esteems freedom of expression and privacy each as a "human right and guarantor of human dignity".  Participants are expected to respect and protect information available to users and users' ability to freely create and distribute information, provided that they operate outside narrowly defined circumstances necessary to adhere to international laws and standards set by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
Participants are also expected to protect users' personal information from illegal or arbitrary interference when confronted with government demands, laws, or regulations that compromise a user's privacy. The same principle of adherence of international laws and standards applies.
Collaboration among stakeholders is key to the goals of the Global Network Initiative. The GNI's outline of principles encourages participants to explore ways to engage governments advance their cause, individually or collectively.
GNI recognizes that the actions of their corporate participants alone cannot guarantee the protection of human rights. One fundamental commitment is to promote the adoption of laws, policies, and practices that protect freedom of expression and privacy. GNI considers governments to be ultimately responsible for the fulfillment of their citizens' human rights, specifically pursuant to freedom of expression and privacy.

== History ==
Ukraine made its first appearance at the top level in 1994, less than five years after gaining independence from the Soviet Union. Ukraine went on to upset the United States, and Ukrainian goaltender Igor Karpenko went on to win top goaltender at the 1995 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Since, there was no relegation round due to the restructuring of the format, in 2001 Junior Ice Hockey Championship the team were participating at the German performance, like a strong and high level players team, from small country of the east Europe. In that year Team Ukraine got a 3rd place rank and deserved  bronze medals of the Division I tournament. This group played in Landsberg and Füssen, Germany between December 10 and December 16, 2000.
The best players of the team Ukraine -"Yuriy Dyachenko" and "Alexandr Bobkin" best of 5 points results 3 scores and 2 assists for both 10 points in summary. Ukraine was not relegated, despite finishing 8th out of 8 teams. Ukraine was relegated to Pool B after finishing 10th in 1996. Four years later, Ukraine made it back to Pool A in 2000, and once again finished 10th. Despite, the relegation, Ukraine didn't lose a game by more than 7 goals. Ukraine earned promotion to top level for 2004 with a one-point differential over Japan, by defeating France 3-0 on the last day. Ukraine experienced troubles in Helsinki, Finland with equipment shortages (ea-sticks, tape), because the country was experiencing economic difficulties. Other teams participating donated sticks, tape, skate laces, and other pieces of equipment to the Ukrainian team. Despite, the generous donations from other teams, Ukraine did not hold up well in the tournament losing to the Czech-Republic (8-0); Switzerland (11-0); Canada (10-0); Finland (14-1). Ukraine went on to lose the relegation round to Sweden (4-0), and tie Austria (2-2). Ukraine has remained at the Division I level since then.

* Ukraine at IIHF.comThe London and North Western Railway (LNWR) 'Class B' was a class of 0-8-0 steam locomotives introduced in 1901.  A development of the three-cylinder compound Class A (though this letter classification was not introduced until 1911), they had a 4-cylinder compound arrangement.  170 were built between 1901-1904.
==Rebuilds==
;Class E
Between 1904 and 1908, Webb's successor George Whale added a leading pony truck to 26 engines, making them 2-8-0s and taking them into Class E (again from 1911).
;Class F
Between 1906 and 1908, Whale also rebuilt 10 with larger Experiment-type boiler to Class F, again adding a leading pony truck. (Two more of Class B were also converted to Class F 'via' Class E).
;Class G
Neither of the above conversions was particularly successful and, as a result, 32 were rebuilt to Class G with 2-cylinder simple expansion between 1910 and 1917.
;Class G1
Whale's Successor Charles Bowen Cooke rebuilt a further 91 direct from Class B to 2-cylinder simple superheated LNWR Class G1 (also known as "Super Ds"). The rebuilds from Class B to Class G1 continued under LMS ownership between 1923 and 1927.
;Summary
A total of 170 locomotives was built but No. 134 was destroyed in a boiler explosion at Buxton on 11 November 1921 leaving 169. The rebuilds (some under LMS ownership) totalled 159, leaving 10 unrebuilt.
==LMS ownership==
The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) inherited 53 unrebuilt Class B locomotives in 1923 and numbered them 8900-8952. The LMS continued to rebuild them to Class G1 and the number of unrebuilt locomotives dwindled to 10.
==Withdrawal==
The remaining 10 Class B locomotives were withdrawn in 1927-1928.  None were preserved.

Born in 1955, Al-Sane obtained a PhD in Business Administration before being elected to the National Assembly in 1992.  While political parties are illegal in Kuwait, Al-Sane affiliates with the Islamist Hadas party.
==Opposes Project Kuwait==
Project Kuwait is a $7 billion, 25-year plan, first formulated in 1997 by the SPC, to increase the country's oil production (and to help compensate for declines at the mature Burgan field), with the help of international oil companies. In particular, Kuwait aims to increase output at five northern oil fields (Abdali, Bahra, Ratqa, Raudhatain, and Sabriya) from their current rate of around  to  within three years.  
Al-Sane opposes Project Kuwait and allowing foreign oil companies into Kuwait.  On December 23, 2005, Al-Sane told the press that he opposed the entry of these foreign companies because it is barred by the constitution:  "The step the government wants to take is against the law, and we have to stand against it strongly...  The constitutional issue is the main one. We're not against foreign investments, but the problem is that you have to stick to the constitution."
==Wary of Ministry Purging==
In May 2007, Al-Sane, chairman of the parliamentary subcommittee for Employment and Administrative Reforms, urged Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah “to intervene and stop some ministers from ousting senior and highly experienced employees from the ministries.” Al-Sane argued that, “some ministers are forcing senior employees who have gained valuable experience in their respective fields to take retirement without even consulting them...  This practice will prove harmful in the long run as employees with very little experience are being appointed at senior positions.” Al-Sane drafted a bill to address the issue, which he believes could be devises between the cabinet and the parliament:  "If the Prime Minister does not take quick measures to end this practice, it will sour the relations between the government and parliament."   
==Defense of Oil Minister Al-Olaim==
In July 2007, several Popular Action Bloc MPs alleged that Oil Minister Mohammad Al-Olaim's bidding process for the refinery at Al-Zour was flawed.  The MPs claimed that the awarding of the contracts was not made under the country's Tenders Law which governs all major public contracts. The MPs also threatened to grill Al-Olaim if he signed the contracts and demanded that the project be scrutinized by the Audit Bureau to make sure that it did not involve squandering of public funds. After initially rejecting the calls, the minister later bowed to pressure and agreed to ask the cabinet to refer the project to the Bureau.
Al-Sane strongly defended Olaim and alleged that vested interests were behind the attacks on the minister. Al-Olaim was a leading member of the Hadas party to which Al-Sane belongs.
==Protested Against Israeli Attacks==
On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers Mikhled Al-Azmi, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq Al-Ghanim, Jaaman Al-Harbash, Ahmad Al-Mulaifi, Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, Ahmad Al-Saadoun, Nasser Al-Sane, and Waleed Al-Tabtabaie protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by Israel on Gaza.  Protesters burned Israeli flags, waved banners reading, "No to hunger, no to submission" and chanted "Allahu Akbar". Israel launched air strikes against Hamas in the Gaza Strip on December 26 after a six-month ceasefire ended on December 18.
==References==Historic Sandusky is a historic home located in Lynchburg, Virginia.  It is a formal two-story, brick "I" house built about 1808, with a later addition.  It was built by Charles Johnston, and is one of the earliest homes in the Lynchburg area to display the architectural details and refinements characteristic of Federal design.
While Charles Johnston lived in the house he was visited by Thomas Jefferson of Poplar Forest who went to the home as a dinner guest December 1817. Jefferson and Johnston knew each other as neighbors and traded goods often. 
The home was then sold to John Mathews Otey, whose family occupied the house from 1821–1841, before it changed hands to George C. Hutter, whose family owned the house for over 110 years.
In 1864, during the Battle of Lynchburg, Sandusky served as Union headquarters. Among those quartered at the home were Gen. David Hunter and future Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes and William McKinley, who served on Hunter's staff. During the occupation by the Union soldiers, the residents of the house, including retired Major Hutter and his family, were locked upstairs. Before retreating, General Hunter gave orders to his troops to ransack the house, and "Union soldiers plunged bayoneted rifles into the family portraits hanging on the walls..."
Other buildings on the property consist of two 20th-century tenant houses, one frame and one brick. It is currently owned and operated by the Historic Sandusky Foundation in partnership with the University of Lynchburg as a house museum related to the American Civil War and the Battle of Lynchburg.

* Historic Sandusky FoundationLudwik Stasiak; portrait by Jacek Malczewski (c.1900)
'Ludwik Józef Stasiak' (13 August 1858, Bochnia - 3 December 1924, Bochnia) was a Polish painter, cartoonist, journalist, art historian and publisher. He worked in a wide variety of genres and provided illustrations for magazines such as ' (Ivy), ' (Ears) and 'Tygodnik Ilustrowany'. He was also the author of some popular historical novels.
== Biography ==
He was born to a middle-class family and his father worked in the Bochnia Salt Mine. When he was of age, he was sent to Kraków to attend a gymnasium. After graduating in 1879, he was undecided about his future, simultaneously studying philosophy at the Jagellonian University and painting at the Academy of Fine Arts. 
Couple Playing Checkers (1894)
After two years, he decided to devote himself entirely to art. Izydor Jabłoński, Władysław Łuszczkiewicz, Florian Cynk, Leopold Löffler and Jan Matejko were among his teachers. During this time, he received several awards from the Kraków Society of Friends of Fine Arts. In 1886, he continued his studies in Vienna under August Eisenmenger and was later in Munich, where he studied with Alexander von Wagner and Alexander von Liezen-Mayer.
After returning home, he became a regular exhibitor with the Kraków Society, showing 142 works in all. He also had exhibits at the Zachęta. His first solo exhibit was in 1893. Two years later, after travelling in Austria and Germany, with a brief stay in Warsaw, he returned to Bochnia and opened a studio which became a gathering point for artists of the Young Poland movement.
In 1898, to counter the dominance of German and Austrian painters in the art print business, he founded the publishing house, "Bochni Wydawnictwo Obrazów Treści Religijnej", which later became the art publisher "Stella". He served as artistic director and many of the works presented were later issued as color postcards. In 1900, he helped organize a major exhibition of Polish artists in Kiev. 
Pilgrims at Jasna Góra Monastery (postcard from 1914)
After 1901, his interests turned from painting to literary work. He wrote historical novels, short stories and three volumes of humorous sketches, all of which proved to be very popular.  He also became interested in the sculptor, Veit Stoss (Wit Stwosz), a major figure in Medieval Kraków. After extensive research, he concluded that Stoss was actually of Polish, not German origin, and wrote several works supporting that thesis.
The Bochnia City Council declared 2008 to be the "Year of Ludwik Stasiak".

*  Desafio Internacional das Estrelas official websiteThe 'Getzen Company' is a family-owned manufacturer and wholesaler of brass instruments. The present product portfolio consists of trumpets, cornets, flugelhorns, trombones, and a baritone horn. Four generations of the Getzen family have participated in the company. Most Getzen instruments are rated well by consumers, and it is well known for its custom line of Edwards trumpets and trombones. 
==History==
===Founding===
In 1939, Anthony James (T.J.) Getzen founded the Getzen Company, in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Getzen had trained in instrument repair with the C.G. Conn company and worked as a plant superintendent for the Frank Holton Company. Initially opened as a repair shop, the company expanded after World War II to instrument manufacture. In 1946, Getzen produced its first trombones. In 1947, Getzen started producing trumpets and cornets as well. In 1949, J. Robert Getzen, T.J.'s son, assumed the position of plant superintendent, and Getzen started to produce piston bugles. These bugles became popular with Drum and Bugle Corps.
===Expansion and sale===
In 1959, J. Robert Getzen left the company to found Allied Music. His brother Donald Getzen briefly assumed the leadership of the company in 1960 and acquired control of the Hoosier Band Instrument Company. Late in 1960, the family sold the company to attorney Harold M. Knowlton. No longer a family-owned business, the company continued to follow the same business model, expanding its visibility through an association with trumpeter Carl “Doc” Severinsen of The Tonight Show fame. In addition to the marketing aspect, this association also produced the Getzen 900 Severinsen Model Eterna trumpet. Producing both student and professional lines, the Getzen company was preparing to expand in October 1963 when the existing facility was destroyed by fire. The new factory opened in February 1964 with only a brief interruption in business. Founder T.J. Getzen died in 1968.
===Modern family business===
In 1985, Harold Knowlton sold Getzen to Charles F. Andrews, and the same year, J. Robert Getzen sold Allied Music to his sons Thomas and Edward. Edward concurrently founded Edwards Trombones. Charles Andrews lost control of the company in bankruptcy in 1991, and the Getzen brothers purchased the firm's assets. Transitioning Allied Music to the original role of the Getzen Company, instrument repair only, the family focused on the Getzen name for brass instrument manufacture with Edwards as a subsidiary. In 1999, Thomas Getzen bought out his brother to become sole owner of the Getzen Company. In 2003, J. Robert Getzen died. In 2009, two of Thomas Getzen's sons were working for the company maintaining the family business model under the leadership of their father.
==Products==
The Getzen Company produces a line of trumpets including the professional level Genesis and Artist lines, the beginner level 300 and 400 series, the step-up line Capri and 700 series, and the semi-pro Eterna series. Additionally, the company builds two models of piccolo trumpet (Capri and Eterna), a herald trumpet, bass trumpet, and field trumpet. The instruments are particularly known for their reliable and durable piston valves.
The company also produces cornets in the 300, 400, Capri, 700, Eterna, and Custom series. flugelhorns are available in the Capri, Eterna, and Custom series. Trombones are produced in the 300, 400, Capri, 700, Eterna, Custom, and Custom Reserve series. Getzen also builds one model of baritone horn.

==Biography==
===Higher education and army life===
Anderson was born August 13, 1919, in Clayton, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. His mother and father were from Mississippi. He earned a bachelor of science degree in Chemistry in 1941 from Lincoln University and received high accolades as he graduated third in his class. Lincoln University was also the place where he met his wife-to-be, Marjorie Anderson. Upon graduating, World War II had begun and enlisted in U.S. Army Air Forces. He was assigned to the meteorology division and Anderson claims that this came about due to the process of elimination. The Army sent him, along with 150 other cadets to the University of Chicago   to study meteorology. While there along with an exceptionally heavy academic course load, Anderson also underwent physical training, weapons training, and specific training in military intelligence. Anderson completed this training in May 1943 and earned his meteorological certification. Upon finishing, he was stationed in Tuskegee, Alabama where he was assigned as a weather officer for the 332nd Fighter Group now known as the Tuskegee Airmen. After his service in Tuskegee, Anderson became a squadron weather officer and trained fighter pilots across the country.
==Post-war career==
Anderson temporarily left the Army Air Corps after the war to pursue an opportunity in high polymer chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1946. After receiving his master's degree, Anderson became a research and development officer for Watson Laboratories, supervising the works of many notable German scientists. In 1955, Anderson decided to further pursue his academic studies and applied to the doctoral program in Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this time he wrote his dissertation: "A Study of the Pulsating Growth of Cumulus Clouds." Anderson earned his Ph.D. in 1960, becoming the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in Meteorology.

==References=='Carolyn Michelle Jarvis' (born July 20, 1979) is a Canadian television journalist, currently the chief correspondent for Global's newsmagazine program '16x9'. Jarvis was born in North York, Ontario and grew up in Richmond, British Columbia. She earned a degree in music, but established a career in investigative journalism and as a news anchor.
==Early life==
Jarvis was born in North York, Ontario in 1979 and moved with her family to Richmond, British Columbia shortly thereafter. Jarvis earned a Bachelor of Music in vocal performance and moved to Toronto to pursue a career in musical theatre.
==Career==
In 2001 Jarvis was a cast member on 'U8TV: The Lofters', where she produced content and hosted shows on the Independent Film Channel and The Life Network among others. The following year she joined the Weather Network as a forecaster and earned a Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society certification, while taking night courses at Ryerson University.
In 2004, Jarvis moved to Red Deer, Alberta and worked briefly for Global Edmonton's sister station RDTV before joining Global News as a reporter and anchor for Global Edmonton. Jarvis anchored the 6:00 News Hour weekend edition. In 2008, Jarvis became a correspondent and weekend anchor for 'Global National'. During her time there Jarvis covered the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, the British Columbia forest fires, and the shooting of Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Jarvis also hosted 'Focus: Decision Canada', a national 30-minute program devoted to the 2011 federal election. In addition to being a correspondent for 'Global National', she also served as western correspondent for '16:9 The Bigger Picture' (now '16x9').
In 2011, while anchoring 'Global National' and reporting on the death of Osama bin Laden, Jarvis repeatedly referred to bin Laden as "Obama", shortly after she was reassigned. Jarvis became chief correspondent for '16x9' and investigated the British Columbia polygamist community of Bountiful, the use of stem cell treatment, and a behind-the-scenes look at casting for Cirque du Soleil.

No further edits should be made to this page.'Our Lady of the Assassins' () is a 2000 Colombian-Spanish-French film by Barbet Schroeder about a Colombian author in his fifties who returns to his hometown of Medellín after 30 years of absence to find himself trapped in an atmosphere of violence and murder caused by drug cartel warfare.  It is adapted from the novel of the same title by Fernando Vallejo.
== Synopsis ==
Fernando (Germán Jaramillo) meets Alexis (Anderson Ballesteros), a handsome gay youth, at a party of one of his old friends and immediately falls for him. The two begin a relationship which, apart from the sex, consists mainly in Fernando telling Alexis how pastoral the city was when he left, while Alexis explains to Fernando the ins and outs of everyday robbery, violence, and shootings. Even though Fernando has come home to die, his sarcastic worldview is mellowed somewhat by his relationship with Alexis.
He soon discovers that Alexis is a gang member and hitman (or 'sicario') himself, and that members of other gangs are after him. After several assassination attempts fail because of Alexis' skillful handling of his Beretta, he is finally killed by two boys on a motorcycle. Fernando is partly responsible for this, as Alexis' weapon has been lost before the murder due to Fernando's suicidal impulses.
Fernando visits Alexis' mother and gives her some money, and then walks through the streets aimlessly when he encounters Wilmar (Juan David Restrepo), who bears a striking resemblance to Alexis, not only in his looks but in his entire manner.
He invites Wilmar for lunch and the two begin an affair, rekindling the kind of relationship he had with Alexis. Wilmar is also a killer, but it is a shocking revelation  to Fernando when he finds out that Wilmar is the one who shot Alexis. He vows to kill Wilmar, but then learns it was Alexis who started the violence by killing Wilmar's brother, calling for vengeance on him by Wilmar.
When Wilmar goes to say goodbye to his mother before he and Fernando leave the country together, he is killed as well. Seeing that the vicious cycle of atrocities in Medellín denies happiness, Fernando presumably commits suicide, if the last scene is taken to hint at that.

No further edits should be made to this page.'CSS 'General Beauregard' was a cottonclad  sidewheel ram of the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War.
Built in Algiers, Louisiana in 1847 as a towboat, the paddle steamer 'Ocean' was selected in January 1862 by Capt. James E. Montgomery, former river steamboat master, for his River Defense Fleet. At New Orleans, on 25 January, Captain Montgomery began her conversion to a cotton-clad ram, installing    oak and   iron sheathing over her bow, with cotton bales sandwiched between double pine bulkheads to protect her boilers.
==Service history==
===Battle of Plum Point Bend===
Conversion completed on 5 April, and now renamed CSS 'General Beauregard', the ship steamed to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, to defend the approaches to Memphis. On 10 May 1862, 'General Beauregard', Capt. J. H. Hart, and seven more of Montgomery's fleet, attacked the Federal Mississippi ironclad flotilla. The Battle of Plum Point Bend witnessed effective ramming tactics by the Confederates, although 'General Beauregard' succeeded only in keeping her four 8-inch guns bravely firing in the face of a withering hail of Union shells. Montgomery's force held off the Federal rams until Fort Pillow was safely evacuated, 4 June, then fell back on Memphis to coal, on the fifth.
===Battle of Memphis===
After Fort Pillow fell, Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis, USN, commanding the Mississippi River Squadron, lost no time in appearing off Memphis, on 6 June 1862. Montgomery, with a smaller squadron short of fuel, was unable to retreat to Vicksburg; unwilling to destroy his boats, he fought against heavy odds. In the ensuing Battle of Memphis, "witnessed by thousands on the bluff," 'Beauregard' unluckily missed ramming  and "cut away entirely the port wheel and wheel-house" of her partner, CSS 'General Sterling Price', also engaging 'Monarch'. 'General Beauregard', backing out, gave Union flagship  a close broadside with a 42-pounder, and 'Benton' replied with a shot into the Confederate's boiler, killing or scalding many of her crew, 14 of whom, in agony, were rescued by 'Benton'. 'General Beauregard' exploded and was sinking fast as 'Monarch' captured the rest of her complement and took her in tow towards the Arkansas shore, where the wreck remained for a short time partially visible in shoal water.

==Rule==
===Treaty with Rome===
Carthage concluded treaties with several states, most notably with Rome. Signed in 509 BC, the treaty formalized a division of influence and commercial activities. This treaty is the first known source suggesting that Carthage had gained control over Sicily and Sardinia, as well as Emporia and the area south of Cape Bon in Africa. Carthage may have signed the treaty with Rome, then an insignificant backwater, because Romans had treaties with the Phocaeans and Cumae, who were aiding the Roman struggle against the Etruscans at that time. Carthage had similar treaties with Etruscan, Punic and Greek cities in Sicily.
By the end of the 6th Century BC, Carthage had conquered most of the old Phoenician colonies e.g. Hadrumetum, Utica and Kerkouane, subjugated some of the Libyan tribes, and had taken control of parts of the North African coast from modern Morocco to the borders of Cyrenaica. It was also fighting wars to defend its Punic colonies and commerce.  However, only the details of her struggle against the Greeks have survived, which has led to the impression that Carthage seemed "obsessed with Sicily".
===First Sicilian War===
The island of Sicily, lying at Carthage's doorstep, became the arena on which this conflict played out. From their earliest days, both the Greeks and Phoenicians had been attracted to the large island, establishing a large number of colonies and trading posts along its coasts. Small battles had been fought between these settlements for decades. Carthage had to respond to at least three Greek incursions, in 580 BC, in 510 BC (involving Dorieus the Spartan, brother of Cleomenes I) and, according to Diodorus Siculus, a war in which the city of Heraclea Minoa was destroyed. 
The Punic domain in Sicily by 500 BC contained the cities of Motya, Panormus and Soluntum. By 490 BC, Carthage had concluded treaties with the Greek cities of Selinus, Himera, and Zankle in Sicily. Gelo, the tyrant of Greek Syracuse, backed in part by support from other Greek city-states, was attempting to unite the island under his rule since 485 BC. When Theron of Akragas, father in law of Gelo, deposed the tyrant of Himera in 483 BC, Carthage decided to intervene at the instigation of the tyrant of Rhegion, who was the father-in-law of the deposed tyrant of Himera.
Hamilcar prepared the largest Punic overseas expedition to date and after three years of preparations, sailed for Sicily. This enterprise coincided with the expedition of Xerxes against mainland Greece in 480 BC, prompting speculation about a possible alliance between Carthage and Persia against the Greeks, although no firm  evidence of this exists. The Punic fleet was battered by storms en route, and the Punic army was destroyed and Hamilcar killed in the Battle of Himera by the combined armies of Himera, Akragas and Syracuse under Gelo. Carthage made peace with the Greeks and paid a large indemnity of 2000 silver talents, but lost no territory in Sicily.
==Weakening of kings==
This defeat had far reaching consequences, both political and economic, for Carthage. Politically, the old government of entrenched nobility was ousted, replaced by the Carthaginian Republic.  “Kings” were still elected, but their power began to erode, with the senate and the "Tribunal of 104" gaining dominance in political matters, and the position of "Suffet" becoming more influential. Economically, sea-borne trade with the Middle East was cut off by the mainland Greeks and Magna Graecia boycotted Carthaginian traders. This led to the development of trade with the West and of caravan-borne trade with the East. Gisco, son of Hamilcar was exiled, and Carthage for the next 70 years made no recorded forays against the Greeks nor aided either the Elymians/Sicels or the Etruscans (then locked in struggles against the Greeks) or sent any aid to the Greek enemies of Syracuse, then the leading Greek city in Sicily. Based on this absence from Greek affairs, it has been suggested that Carthage was militarily crippled for some time after the defeat at Himera.

If you are still convinced that the character could require deletion, then rewrite the nomination and note why it was rewritten.

'Tytus Filipowicz' (1873–1953) was a Polish politician and diplomat. 
==Life==
Filipowicz was born November 21, 1873 in Warsaw. He attended school in Dąbrowa Górnicza. He worked as a coal miner and became a socialist political activist; from 1895 he was active in the Dąbrowa Workers' Committee. He became an active member of the Polish Socialist Party ('PPS') and editor of a socialist paper for miners ('Górnik', Miner). In 1901 he was arrested by the authorities but escaped to Russian-ruled Warsaw.
During the 'PPS' split, he sided with the Polish Socialist Party – Revolutionary Faction and became a close collaborator of future Polish statesman Józef Piłsudski. He accompanied Piłsudski on his 1904 voyage to Japan. In 1905 Filipowicz was imprisoned by the Russian Empire in the Warsaw Citadel, but escaped.
Under the Second Polish Republic, he was briefly deputy or acting (sources vary) Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs (11–17 November 1918). Later he was named Poland's ambassador to Georgia—due to his involvement in Piłsudski's Prometheist project—but in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Georgia (which was subsequently annexed as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic) he did not assume this post but was instead arrested there by the Soviets and interned. After the treaty of Riga ended the Polish-Soviet War in 1921, he became the first Polish chargé d'affaires in the Soviet Union, organizing the Polish embassy there. Later he was a diplomat in Finland, Belgium and the United States (1929-32). 
In 1934, with Gabriel Czechowicz, Filipowicz co-founded the Polish Radical Party ('Polska Partia Radykalna'), a dissident offshoot of Sanation that, while largely adhering to political liberalism, advocated that Poland become a Christian state, with official preferences given to ethnic Poles, and Jews being encouraged to emigrate.
During and after World War II, Filipowicz was a member of the Polish Government in Exile and of the National Council of the Republic of Poland (1941–42 and 1949–53).
He died August 18, 1953, in London.

==Notes=='The Chosen Few' is a 1979 album by British pop group The Dooleys.
The album contains the singles "Chosen Few" and "Wanted" - both of which were top 10 hits. "Wanted" had already appeared on the group's previous album, 'The Best of The Dooleys', but appeared here in a slightly extended version. Current single "Chosen Few" reached No.7 in the UK Charts, after previous single had reached No.3 and album No.6, making this the peak of the group's career. This album however only managed to reach No.56, although that was an improvement on the group's previous studio album, which missed the charts completely in 1978.
Track "One Kiss Away" had been previously recorded by Billy Ocean (who also co-wrote it under his real name, Les Charles), while "Growing Pains" had been recorded by Guys 'n' Dolls in 1977.
'The Chosen Few' was released on Compact disc for the first time on 14 September 2009 in a double-pack with their debut album, 'Dooleys'.

== Biography ==
Eusebius held the position of 'praepositus sacri cubiculi' in 337, when Constantine I died; he concealed the will of the Emperor. Eusebius became a supporter of Arianism, influencing the empress and many other eunuchs. He entered then at the service of one of Constantine's sons and successors, Constantius II, with whom he shared the support for Arianism and on whom he exerted a great influence.
In 354 Eusebius was sent by Constantius II to talk to Pope Liberius and then attended at the meeting between the Emperor and the Pope. He sent money to the orator Libanius in exile and, in 355, helped those Arian bishops who plotted against Athanasius of Alexandria.
Eusebius followed Constantius into Gaul (353-354) and then to Milan (354). Here he plotted against Constantius' cousin, brother-in-law and Caesar, Constantius Gallus; Constantius ordered him to go to Pula, where Gallus was imprisoned, to question him about his rule in the East.
Eusebius enriched himself taking the properties of those who were put to death on accusations of treason; when general Ursicinus refused to give him as a present his house in Antioch, in 359, Eusebius had him recalled from his office as 'magister equitum', having Sabinianus as a substitute.
Eusebius was together with Constantius until the Emperor died, in 361. The new Emperor, Julian, set up the Chalcedon tribunal to judge all those officers of Constantius' who had been suspected of corrupt conduct, in particular in the case of the trial and execution of Gallus (Julian's half-brother); Eusebius was accused of plotting against Gallus, was found guilty, and was put to death.

In a 'bǎ' construction, the object of a verb is placed after the function word  (or, in more formal writing, ), and the verb placed after the object, forming a subject–object–verb (SOV) sentence.  Linguists commonly analyze 'bǎ' as a light verb construction, or as a preposition.

==Usage==
The 'bǎ' construction may only be used in certain contexts, generally those in which the verb expresses "settlement" of, or action upon, the object.  According to Wang Li, "the disposal form states how a person is handled, manipulated, or dealt with; how something is disposed of; or how an affair is conducted," or, in other words, "what happens to" the object.  Therefore, it is generally used with verbs that are high in transitivity, a property that describes the effect a verb has on its object; 'bǎ' does not occur grammatically with verbs that express states or emotions, such as "love" and "miss," or with verbs that express activities that have no effect on the direct object, such as "sing" and "see."
The direct object of a 'bǎ' construction must meet certain requirements as well.  It is usually definite, meaning that it is specific and unique (as in phrases beginning with the equivalent of 'this', 'that', 'these', or 'those'). It may sometimes also be generic, such as "salt" in the sentence "She sometimes eats salt thinking it's sugar."  The object of a 'bǎ' construction is nearly always something that both the speaker and hearer know about and are aware of.
==Research==
Because of the numerous constraints on the kinds of words that may be used in 'bǎ' construction, this construction has often been used in studies on language processing and on grammaticality judgments of native speakers.  For example, sentences with 'bǎ' construction that have syntactic violations (such as 'bǎ' being followed by a verb rather than a noun) and semantic violations (such as 'bǎ' being followed by a verb that doesn't express "disposal") have been used to study the interaction of syntactic and semantic processing in the brain using the neuroimaging technique of ERP, and to evaluate construction grammar's model of meaning-building.

No further edits should be made to this page.'Marc Iliffe' (27 June 1972 – 11 February 2003) was a British strongman famous for being the winner of Britain's Strongest Man contest in 2002.
==Career==
Iliffe was acknowledged as being extremely dedicated to the sport of strength athletics. His training partner of ten years, Bill Pittuck, talked of Marc's particular love of the Atlas stones event which helped him win the title of Britain's Strongest Man in 2002.  Iliffe was also invited to compete at the World's Strongest Man finals in consecutive years. Iliffe's career was affected in 2002 by a split disc in his back that had caused weakness in his legs. However, surgery to correct the injury looked very positive. On his personal website he said: "I have now had an MRI scan and the bottom disk in my back is split, so I go into the woodlands private Hospital in Kettering on the 22nd of October to  surgery to fix the problem, so I will be back fighting fit very soon and will be at BSM 2003 to hopefully win title for a second time. Can't wait to get it sorted as it has caused problems the last few months,and will be back in training very soon the surgeon . It should not cause me any more problems and is near enough an instant fix, and leg pain and weakness will be gone instantly."
==Television and film==
As well as televised strongman competitions, Marc appeared in a television advertisement for rock group Pulp’s 'Hits' album before Christmas 2002 and had been cast in a film called 'Transfer' by GMV Entertainment along with the boxer Richie Woodhall, in which he was due to play a gangster.
==Death==
On 11 February 2003, Marc Iliffe was discovered hanged from gym equipment at his Northamptonshire home in Vivian Road. The Northamptonshire coroner recorded an open verdict on the death of Mr Iliffe, of Wellingborough. No suicide note was left but he was believed to be having some marital and work problems. Additionally, he was disappointed the strongman competition sponsors were not using him in publicity campaigns. His mother, Kathleen Carmichael of Rushden, stated that: "My son wasn't depressed. Frustrated, in turmoil, but not depressed". His wife, June Iliffe, also cast doubt on whether the suicide was deliberate. She did not think he meant to kill himself and she stated "He knew I was going to be home in the next 20 minutes and he wouldn't have wanted his son to find him."
==Personal life==
Outside of strongman competition, Marc worked at Ilmor Engineering, Brixworth. He was married to June Iliffe, had two stepsons, aged 15 and 19, as well as a six-year-old son, Marc Junior. At the time of his death he lived in Wellingborough in Northamptonshire.

* www.rawmuscle.com - Marc Iliffe's personal website'Go Down, Death!' is a 1944 race film directed by and starring Spencer Williams. The film's title derives from a poem by the African-American writer James Weldon Johnson.
==Plot==
'Go Down Death' takes place in an African-American community where the criminal boss Big Jim Bottoms (Spencer Williams) runs a successful juke joint. The arrival of a new preacher (Samuel H. James) to the town results in many of Big Jim's customers leaving the juke joint in favor of attending church. Big Jim arranges for the preacher to be photographed in staged compromising situations with three attractive women. Aunt Caroline, Big Jim's adoptive mother, becomes aware of the scheme and tries to prevent Big Jim from carrying out his scheme to discredit the preacher. There is a physical struggle between Aunt Caroline and Big Jim, resulting in Aunt Caroline collapsing after being struck. Aunt Caroline dies from her injuries, but Big Jim escapes arrest by claiming an unknown burglar was the culprit. But following Aunt Caroline's funeral, Big Jim's conscience haunts him with visions of eternal damnation in Hell. His body is later discovered in a canyon and the photographs of the preacher are nowhere to be found.
==Production==
'Go Down Death' was the third in a trilogy of religious oriented films directed by Spencer Williams, an African-American filmmaker, for the production and distribution company. He previously directed 'The Blood of Jesus' (1941) and the now-lost 'Brother Martin: Servant of Jesus' (1942). Publicity material for the production listed the film's original title as 'Go Down, Death! The Story of Jesus and the Devil'.
To depict the horrors of Hell, Williams used clips from the Italian silent film 'L'Inferno' (1911), which had been an international success.
In the course of its distribution, 'Go Down Death' ran into several censorship problems. The state censors for Maryland, New York, and Ohio demanded that edits to the Hell sequence involving a brief exposure of a woman's bare breast in a scene from 'L'Inferno', and the action of a woman pulling up her dress. Ohio censors also requested removal of an image from the Hell sequence where a devil is seen chewing a man.

*'The Teardrops' were an English punk/new wave band formed in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, England, in 1978. The founders and always the core of this band were Trevor Wain, John Key and Jimmy Donnelly with various good friends from the Prestwich music scene:- Buzzcocks bassist Steve Garvey, members of The Fall; Martin Bramah, Karl Burns and Tony Friel and former member of V2 Ian Nance, as well as occasional contributions from Dave Brisbane, Helen Harbrook, Dave Price and Rick Goldstraw.
==History==
Initially, the band line up was, (as pictured) Steve Garvey then in Buzzcocks, Martin Bramah who was in The Fall at that time, Trevor Wain,  Jimmy Donnelly,  John Key and Karl Burns who, at that time, was also in The Fall. It was this line-up with the addition of Dave Brisbane that recorded (at Cargo Studios) and released their debut EP, 'In And Out Of Fashion'. Because of contractual difficulties with The Fall the band were never able to credit Martin Bramah or Karl Burns on the record sleeve.
Due to the communal nature of the band it was not always clear who, apart Trevor Wain, Jimmy Donnelly and John Key were in the band at anyone time.  By the end of 1978 Steve Garvey was committed to his work in Buzzcocks. Martin Bramah in 1979 had left The Fall to form Blue Orchids with Una Baines.  Karl Burns also left The Fall and continued to make a strong contribution to the band. Tony Friel who had left The Fall before they recorded to form The Passage with Dick Witts helped out on some tracks. Most of the recordings at this period varied between Cargo Studios in Rochdale with John Brierly, Smile Studios and Arrow Studios in Manchester. When Graveyard Studios opened in Prestwich all subsequent recordings were done there. The Teardrops along with all their associated bands recorded there as well as a lot of other Manchester bands including Joy Division and A Certain Ratio.
By the end of 1980, The Teardrops stopped recording.
In 2010 a further set of tapes from the Graveyard Studio sessions were rediscovered and restored by Blind Eye Records. This format of the group contained the stalwarts Trevor Wain, Jimmy Donnelly and  John Key  along with Ian Nance. The recordings contain contributions from Steve Garvey, Martin Bramah and Karl Burns. Blind Eye Records are planning to release a series of 7" vinyls in late 2010 into early 2011.
They undertook gigs at The Russell Club (Factory Nights) in Hulme and Eric's in Liverpool with Private Sector, Fast Cars and V2.

* 'Kathy Mattea' at AllMusicThe 'Close Rolls' are an administrative record created in medieval England by the royal chancery, in order to preserve a central record of all letters close issued by the chancery in the name of the Crown. 
==History==
The first surviving Close Roll was started in 1204 (in the reign of King John), under the Chancellorship of Hubert Walter, though the actual practice may reach back to 1200, or even before. Copies of the texts of the letters were written on sheets of parchment, which were stitched together into long rolls to form a roll for each year. 
==Nature of contents==
Copies of royal grants of land or money (further transcribed to the Exchequer) made up the earliest contents of the Close Rolls; but the latter soon came to contain much wider matter, exchequer-related material being hived off after 1226 in separate Liberate Rolls. Indeed, in the early 13th century perhaps the bulk of executive action ran via instructions from Chancery to local sheriffs, and was recorded in the Rolls. Over time, however, as new document series emerged, the scope of the Close Rolls narrowed; and after 1533 their contents consisted solely of copies of private deeds and awards of enclosure, and the like.
Until that point, however, the Close Rolls contained a mine of information about late medieval England.  Setting aside political and military matters, or the regulation of commerce or of the Angevin Jewry, the origins of representation and parliament can, for example, be followed in the “twelve of the better and more discreet men” of Bristol summoned by King John in 1211, as well as in Close Rolls copies of letters of summons of barons to Parliament. Culturally, a royal gift of a scarlet cloak to a man about to become a knight sheds possible light on the origins of the Knights of the Bath; while the detailed concern of Henry III for the decoration of his treasures, as purchased through the Close Rolls, reveals the extent of his connoisseurship.
==Publications==
The Close Rolls for the years 1204 to 1227 were published as abbreviated Latin texts (in a near-facsimile of the manuscripts, employing a special "record type" font) by the Record Commission, edited by T. D. Hardy, in 1833 and 1844, in two large folio volumes entitled 'Rotuli Litterarum Clausarum in Turri Londinensi asservati'. Those for the years 1227 to 1272 were published by the Public Record Office between 1902 and 1938, with extended Latin texts, in fourteen volumes entitled 'Close Rolls', of which eleven were edited by W. H. Stevenson. A "supplementary" volume of additional material for the years 1244–66 appeared in 1975. The post-1272 rolls have not been published as full texts but in calendar form (i.e. as comprehensive English summaries, with all significant details included), under the title 'Calendar of Close Rolls': 47 volumes appeared between 1900 and 1963, covering the years 1272 to 1509. Those for the reign of Henry VIII (1509–47) have not been independently published, but are incorporated into the series 'Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII' (published 1862–1932).
The published texts and calendars from 1227 to 1509 have been made available online in a fully searchable form on a "premium" (subscription) section of the digital library British History Online (co-managed by the Institute of Historical Research).

* Biographical information for William Francis Smith from The Political Graveyard'Chantry Academy' (formerly Suffolk New Academy and Chantry High School) is a secondary school with academy status in the Chantry area of Ipswich in the English county of Suffolk. The school educates children aged 11 to 16 and has around 750 pupils. The current principal, Craig D'Cunha, took up the post in February 2015.
In 2018, the academy received a 'good' Ofsted inspection rating.
==History==
The school opened in September 1962 as a secondary modern school serving the recently established council estate of Chantry in southwest Ipswich. Originally, the school consisted of the two three-floored 'A' and 'G' blocks with a main school hall area. Following the growth of the estate, the school's roll grew rapidly into the 1970s, resulting in the extension of the site. The school remained a secondary modern school until the late 1970s when Suffolk became fully comprehensive and the school was renamed Chantry High School.
In March 2012, the school announced its intentions to convert to academy status in collaboration with Suffolk New College. This conversion was finalised during the following academic year, when the school was renamed Suffolk New Academy.
During the summer of 2014, the old 'G' block was demolished in preparation for the building work of a brand new school on the existing site.  This building work took place throughout the 2014–15 academic year, and saw rise to the construction of a three-storey building plus sports hall. The old 'A' block was subsequently demolished in the summer of 2015, with the remaining old buildings due to follow suit.
In early 2015, the school revealed that the Active Learning Trust would be taking over sponsorship from September 2015. This would coincide with the opening of the new school building and another name change. In May 2015, following a public consultation, the school announced it would be reverting to the Chantry name under the guise of Chantry Academy, which had received 66% of the public vote.
Before Mr D’Chuna took charge of the high school, Ofsted (an organisation which judges schools to determine how efficient a school is) reported that the school was put into ‘special measures’, as of 2018, the secondary school has shown an improvement as it has now been given a rated of ‘good’ by Ofsted.
==Sixth Form Centre==
In 1981 the school opened a sixth form centre. Originally, it served Chantry, East Bergholt, Stoke, Copleston, Kesgrave, and numerous smaller schools, acting as an alternative to the already established Northgate Sixth Form centre.
In the 1990s, due to the increase of Sixth Form Centres within Ipswich, Chantry Sixth Form Centre predominantly served just the Chantry and Stoke areas. It closed following the development of the One sixth form in September 2010.

*  Chantry Academy website'Freddie Thomason Burdette' (September 15, 1936 – June 1, 2010) was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs.
Burdette was signed by the Cubs on June 3, 1954 as an undrafted amateur free agent. He battled his way through the minor leagues before finally making his major-league debut at age 25, pitching in relief in both games of a doubleheader with the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field. He induced the first batter he ever faced, Leo Cárdenas, to ground out to second baseman Ken Hubbs. He also retired Gordy Coleman on a groundout before being removed from the game. In the nightcap, Burdette pitched a full inning, allowing a hit but no runs. On September 10, he tallied his first big-league strikeout, fanning slugger Frank Howard. He also earned his first (and only) career save when he finished a 4–1 victory over Philadelphia on September 20. Burdette went on to finish the year with a 3.72 ERA in 9 innings over 8 games. The next year, he was a late-season call-up from the minors for the Cubs, appearing in 4 games as a reliever and posting a 3.86 ERA.
Burdette saw his most extensive major-league action in 1964, making 18 appearances out of the bullpen after getting promoted to the big leagues in June. He earned his first major-league win (and only decision) on August 18 against the Phillies in a marathon 16-inning contest at Connie Mack Stadium. Burdette retired six of the seven Phillie batters he faced in the 14th and 15th innings before being removed for a pinch-hitter as the Cubs rallied for two runs in the top of the 16th. Ernie Broglio (famously acquired by the Cubs in exchange for legend Lou Brock) allowed a solo homer in the bottom of the 16th to Clay Dalrymple but held on to save Burdette's only career win.
Burdette pitched in eight more games as a Cub in 1964, including his final appearance on October 2, 1964 against the San Francisco Giants. He hurled two-thirds of an inning, retiring opposing pitcher Bobby Bolin to end the final inning Burdett would pitch in the bigs.
For his career, Burdette was 1–0 in 30 games (all in relief) with one save and a 3.41 ERA.
==Later life==
Following his baseball career, Burdette worked for the United Parcel Service. He died on June 1, 2010 in Albany, Georgia, where he had resided since 1955.

* Obituary from 'The Albany Herald''West Wemyss' () is a village lying on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, in Fife, Scotland. According to the 2007 population estimate, the village has a population of 237. The village was granted burgh of barony status in 1511, bearing the name from the Wemyss family who lived in Wemyss Castle.
== History ==
The village of West Wemyss began as a settlement around the site of Wemyss Castle which developed into a centre for the salt industry in the area. An epidemic of plague arrived in Scotland in July 1584, brought to West Wemyss in a ship called a crayer.
A harbour was later built in 1621 by the Wemyss family for the use of coal exportation from the pits on the lands of their estate. The harbour would become a major export point for coal by the late 17th century. The ships brought back imports of wood, iron and flax from the Baltic Countries. A wet dock was added for the increased demand of the coal in the 1870s. Towards the latter stages of the 19th century, the village found itself surrounded by several mines - such as the Michael Pit in nearby East Wemyss. The industry, which saw trade with England and The Low Countries, started to struggle once the new docks were opened in Methil further along the Fife coast. Gradually, the demand for the harbour began to fall and it went into decline. The harbour has since been filled in and part of the old village restored, becoming a conservation area with several attractive buildings. William Angus Knight, Professor of Moral Philosophy at St Andrews University, editor and biographer of William Wordsworth, lived here as a child from 1844.
The manse in the village was rebuilt in 1894 to a design by Robert Lorimer.
==Present day==
The West Wemyss development trust have been pivotal in the re-creation of village services. A 2009 report identified various options for the Wemyss Arms, a disused pub. In 2012 the building has been re-opened as a bistro, cafe, shop and bunkhouse, providing much needed local facilities.

=== Notes ===In addition to 'epinikia', a victorious athlete might be honored with a statue, as with this charioteer found at Delphi, probably a champion driver at the Pythian Games
The 'epinikion' or 'epinicion' (plural 'epinikia' or 'epinicia', Greek , from 'epi-', "on," + 'nikê', "victory") is a genre of occasional poetry also known in English as a 'victory ode'. In ancient Greece, the 'epinikion' most often took the form of a choral lyric, commissioned for and performed at the celebration of an athletic victory in the Panhellenic Games and sometimes in honor of a victory in war. Major poets in the genre are Simonides, Bacchylides, and Pindar.
==Origins==
aulist plays music in the background of a boxing match (Attic vase, 510–500 BC)
Since the poets most often call their victory songs 'hymnoi' (), it has been conjectured that hymns for Herakles, honored as the founder of the Olympic Games, were the original model for the athletic 'epinikion'. Victory odes are also associated with the Dioscuri; Pindar uses the term "Castor-song" (), and Polydeuces (Pollux), the mortal twin of Castor, was a boxer.
Although the best-known 'epinikia' appear to have been composed for a chorus, they may have originally been performed by a soloist. Pindar says that a lyric by Archilochus was sung at Olympia, and a scholiast to the passage gives a quotation. The performance of these songs seems to have led in the 6th century BC to aristocratic commissions for more elaborate numbers.
The earliest 'epinikia', surviving only in fragments, were composed by Simonides of Ceos in the 520s BC. Simonides was the first professional poet known to write odes in honor of victorious athletes at the games; in antiquity, he was also notorious for being the first poet to charge a fee for his services. The 'epinikia' of Bacchylides were formerly considered lost and were known only from quotations in other authors, until the discovery in the late 19th century of a papyrus manuscript containing fifteen of his odes. Pindar's four surviving books of 'epinikia', called one of "the great monuments of Greek lyric," correspond to each of the four major festivals of the Panhellenic Games: Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean. Many of Pindar's odes can be identified by event, champion, and year.
==Occasion and performance==
A phorminx
The 'epinikion' was performed not at the games, but at the celebration surrounding the champion's return to his hometown or perhaps at the anniversary of his victory. The odes celebrate runners, pentathletes, wrestlers, boxers, and charioteers; Pindar usually narrates or alludes elaborately to a myth connected to the victor's family or birthplace. The Pindaric ode has a metrical structure rivaled in its complexity only by the chorus of Greek tragedy, and is usually composed in a triadic form comprising strophe, antistrophe, and epode. The odes were performed by a chorus that sang and danced to the musical accompaniment of the phorminx or aulos.
==The 'epinikion' and society==
"The victory ode," notes Mary Lefkowitz, "is a curious and somewhat paradoxical form of art."  Simon Goldhill has described the 'epinikion' as practiced by Pindar as "a performance hired to mark the place of an individual within his city." The 'epinikion' praised the victorious athlete as an ideal representative of the community and of the aristocratic class, linking his achievements with those of local cult heroes. But the athlete was also admonished against hubris, "not to seek to become Zeus."
A later contributor to the genre was Callimachus.

==Early life==
Born in 1948  near Altrincham, Cheshire, Southern studied Ancient History and Archaeology with the Universities of London and Newcastle upon Tyne.
==Career==
Southern was the librarian of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne from 1983 to 1996 and later at the library of the Newcastle upon Tyne Literary and Philosophical Society. She has published 13 books on Roman history and archaeology and contributed numerous articles on Roman history to the BBC History website and the academic Roman studies journal Britannia.
She has also written a history of her home town of Altrincham.
Southern's first two books 'The Roman Cavalry' and 'The Late Roman Army' were co-authored and illustrated by Karen Dixon. Dixon also illustrated several other books in the publisher's catalogue. Dixon's analysis of morale in the late Roman Army was well received  and influenced the development of the study of military psychology in history pioneered by John Keegan in 'The Face of Battle'.

It began operation on November 22, 2008, and was granted a license on January 8, 2009.  With a transmitter located just north of Benton Harbor, the station uses the same tower as WCXT. WSIS broadcasts the Smile FM programming.  It officially retransmits the signal of WHYT, however, much of the programming comes from flagship station WLGH in Lansing.  WSIS is owned by Smile FM.
An application to construct the station was filed with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on May 12, 1998, for 25 kW with a directional signal from a 184' tower just south of St. Joseph.  A Construction Permit was granted on November 15, 2005, however, in the 7 years between the filing of the application and granting of a construction permit the tower location was no longer available.  A modification was filed with the FCC to move the station to the WCXT tower north of Benton Harbor.  This was rejected and the construction permit was canceled on August 5, 2008, by the FCC on the grounds that the new coverage area did not include the southern portion of the original coverage area which was a violation of the 307(b)preference they had received. Superior Communications filed a request for reconsideration with a waiver of the 73.2002(c) rules.  The waiver stated it was impossible to duplicate the original coverage area since land was no longer available for a tower near the 1998 proposed site.  Furthermore, it said the new location would cover 87% of the original population, add 30,000 to the total population served, and provide a first non-commercial radio service to over 2,000 people.  The FCC granted the modified construction permit on November 13, 2008, and the station filed for a license on November 25, 2008.

Agia Sofia is a small settlement, 2 km northwest of Fisini and 4 km south of Kaminia. It was first mentioned in 1303. The present church was built in 1974, and replaced a building from 1914 that was damaged in the 1968 earthquake. According to tradition the settlement was originally built towards the west near the coast, at the locality 'Paliomantra'. It was marked on the 1785 map of Choiseul-Gouffier at this old location, but Conze marked it at the present location in 1858. The move of the village must have taken place at the end of the 18th century, which coincides with an increase of pirate attacks. Also in the new location the villagers had to protect themselves against pirates, and built unique underground shelters known as 'moursa'. Gradually, the village grew. In 1857, 73 men aged 18 to 60 paid 2,336 piastres to escape conscription.  It had 35 families in 1863 and had 74 houses in 1874. Since 1918 Agia Sofia is part of the community of Fisini. Agia Sofia had 277 inhabitants in 1928, it had 191 in 1961 and only 55 in 2001. The public school, opened in 1919, was closed in 1972.
 
East of the village the ruins of the locality Agiomarnos can be found.
===Paradeisi===
The hill Paradeisi (286 m elevation) dominates southeastern Lemnos. It is situated northwest of Agia Sofia, and southwest of Kaminia. On old maps it is referred to as "Neptune hill" (Colle di Nettune) (Porcacchi, 1572), Neptunius Collis (Ortelius, 1589 and Mercator, 1607 and 1630). The name Paradeisi ("paradise") was first mentioned on a map of Joseph Roux (1764).

==References=='New York Polyphony' is a male classical vocal quartet based in New York City.
Music of the Renaissance and Medieval periods constitutes the core of the ensemble’s repertoire, but increasingly, new music occupies an important place both in performance and on recording. Since their founding in 2006, New York Polyphony has demonstrated a commitment to contemporary music and—in the case of commissions by Andrew Smith, Gabriel Jackson, Jackson Hill and others—works by living composers. In addition, the ensemble frequently collaborates with musicians working in different mediums such as experimental performer/ composer Bora Yoon and violinist Lizzie Ball. Recent events include the European premiere of the 'Missa Charles Darwin'—a newly commissioned secular Mass setting based on texts of Charles Darwin by composer Gregory Brown—at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, and participation in Jonathan Berger’s chamber opera cycle 'Visitations' at the Prototype Festival with soprano Mellissa Hughes and JACK Quartet.
New York Polyphony tours extensively throughout the United States and Europe. They have participated in major international festivals and concert series, including the Miller Theatre Music Series at Columbia University; Rheingau Musik Festival, Thüringer Bachwochen (Germany); Festival Oude Muziek Utrecht (Netherlands); Stiftskonzerte Oberösterreich (Austria); Festival de Música de Morelia (Mexico); Elora Festival (Canada); and Choral at Cadogan Hall in London.
Since 2011, New York Polyphony has recorded for BIS Records. Their 2014 effort 'Sing thee Nowell' scored the ensemble a second GRAMMY nomination, following the critically acclaimed release 'Times go by Turns' (2013).
Prior to signing with BIS Records, New York Polyphony released two albums on the British label Avie Records: 'I sing the birth' (2007) and 'Tudor City' (2010). Both received substantial critical acclaim, with the latter reaching #6 on the 'Billboard' classical chart in June 2010.
In 2011, a Gregorian chant remix competition sponsored by Indaba Music resulted in the digital album 'Devices and Desires'.
New York Polyphony made their television debut in December 2011 on The Martha Stewart Show.
The group comprises countertenor Geoffrey Williams, tenor Steven Caldicott Wilson, baritone Christopher Herbert and bass Craig Phillips.

'This peer review discussion has been closed.' 
I've listed this article for peer review because after a couple of days improving the article I think it is close to achieving good article as the lack of images and the need for a proper copyedit mean it is not near featured standard yet. Hopefully any glaring discrepancies can be fixed and the article can improve. Thanks in advance for your comments NapHit (talk) 00:31, 1 December 2008 (UTC)
:I have probably not enough experience to do a very good peer review and I'm not a native speaker either. But I will make some suggestions anyway:
*Some links are still missing. In the first paragraph England has a wikilink, but Italy not so; links to tactics later, when discussing formations.
*On other occasions the placement of links appears to be somewhat random (no offense). I don't understand, when you added a link to Clarence Seedorf and when not for example.
*"goals coming courtesy of ...". It is probably not PoV but sounds very prosaic, too much for my linking. Probably it's just me being non-native.
*Still some copyediting is required: In 'Route to the final "Third" is capitalized an the score of Milan vs. Inter has the wrong hyphen, etc. There are many similar smallish mistakes. (match summary, 5th para: "in three years he final")
*References missing: Who expected Milan to field 4-4-2? Also Liverpool seems to have been expected to field a 4-5-1 according to the UEFA ref.
*The match report is not using time consistently: Present here, past there, back and forth...
*Would "post match" not be more appropriately be titled as "aftermath"?
:As a conclusion I like to say that the PoV issues mentioned in the previous PR seem to have been mostly resolved. Copyediting is still an issue, though.

No further edits should be made to this page.'Michel Buillard' (born September 9, 1950) is a French politician. He has served as the Mayor of Papeete since 1995 and a former deputy of the National Assembly of France from 1997 to 2012.  He represents the islands of French Polynesia and is a member of the Union for a Popular Movement.
== Biography ==
After attending school at the Brothers' School in Ploërmel where he obtained his baccalaureate degree in 1969, he began his professional career at the bottom of the scale at the Socrédo bank, then went on to hold administrative posts before returning to school and obtaining a degree in law from the University of Bordeaux in 1979.
In 1983, he was appointed Director of the Territorial Office for Health and Social Action (OTASS). That same year saw his entry into politics in the Tahoeraa huiraatira and his election to the municipal council of Pirae in the team of Gaston Flosse.
In 1984, French Polynesia gained internal autonomy. First Polynesian president, Gaston Flosse named him a member of the government of French Polynesia by assigning a large ministry in charge of Labor, Employment, Vocational Training and Housing. After the territorial elections of 1986, he took the portfolio of Youth, Sports and Housing.
In December 1987, following a reversal of the majority, Michel Buillard returned to the Assembly of French Polynesia, where he sat as an advisor in the opposition Tahoeraa Huiraatira ranks.
In 1989, he founded the association Ia Ora Papeete, at the head of which he was fighting for the first time the mayor of Papeete. He fails, but at 38, he gets a very honorable score of 21.5% against an outgoing mayor, Jean Juventin, then at the height of its popularity.
After the territorial elections of March 1991, the Tahoeraa Huiraatira returns to power. Gaston Flosse appointed him vice-president of the government and awarded him the Ministry of Health, Solidarity, Housing and Research.
On June 24, 1995, Michel Buillard was elected mayor of Papeete after the victory of his list Ia Ora Papeete in the second round against the outgoing mayor Louise Carlson.
In June 1997, he was elected MP and left the government. He will remain in this position for three terms (RPR then UMP), re-elected in 2002 and again in 2007. He does not run again in 2012.
He is re-elected mayor of Papeete in 2001, in 2008 and in 2014.
In May 2013, he was elected representative to the French Polynesia Assembly on the Tahoeraa Huiraatira list, then chair of the Committee on Institutions, International and European Affairs, Solidarity, Employment and Relations with the Commons .
In September 2013, he published Tamarii Tahiti, a collection of memories of childhood and youth (Mahana - Les Éditions du Soleil - Tahiti).

}The 'Epie' and 'Atissa' are two Nations that live along Epie Creek, northeast of Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Together, they are commonly known at the 'Epie-Atissa'. This people was established by migrants mainly from the Engenni to the north. The Engenni people are an Edoid group. The Epie-Atissa share cultural aspects of both the Ijaw and the Engenni.
Epie-Atissa settlements include: Onopa, Igbogene, Kpansia, Ogu, Edepie, Yenaka, Opolo, Swali, Ikolo, Akenfa, Yenagoa, and Biogbolo.
They speak the Epie language.
The Epie and Atissa remain two separate Nations. The Epie have villages that run from Igbogene to Amarata; namely, Igbogene, Yenegwe, Akenfa, Agudama Epie, Akenpai, Edepie, Okutukutu, Opolo, Biogbolo, Yenizue Gene, Kpansia, Yenizue Epie, Okaka, Ekeki, Azikoro and Amarata. The Atissa have villages that run from Onopa to Ikolo to Ogu to Agbura namely Onopa, Ovom, Yenagoa, Bebelebiri, Yenaka, Ikolo, Famgbe, Obogoro, Akaba, Ogu, Swali, and Agbura. The Epie language is recorded sometime in the 1970s to have had about 12000 speakers spread from Igbogene to Amarata, but within the last 30 years the numbers of living speakers have greatly reduced. Though there is no current record of the numbers of speakers, the Epie language is not spared from the global epidemic that has befallen most of the world's little languages. The forces that have contributed greatly to the decline in the numbers of speakers are not new. Urbanisation and westernisation are factors, but another major problem that has contributed to the decline is the absence of certain cultural norms that one would usually find in other Nigerian ethnic groups. For example, the traditional chiefs and elders of council are very young men and women, some of them in their 20s. These young people have lost touch of the basic cultural heritage and are hence not capable of transferring it to the younger generations. Many cultural aspects of the Epie-Atissa people have been lost, mainly due to the loss of traditional culture in favor of Western ideals.
The Epie-Atissa kingdom has been the eye-base of business in Bayelsa state. The largest public local market, situated at Swali in the Atissa clan, has been very resourceful to the people of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.
Akenfa, one of the most important cities in the kingdom, is approximately 4 km square, making it the third largest community in the kingdom by area. Akenfa is currently ruled by a locally elected chief, Saiyah, who has ruled the community for approximately 12 years. According to the traditions of the Epie-Atissa kingdom, a chief will only be elected if the active chief is dead and buried for three months. The people of Akenfa have deviated from formal tradition and made the kingship an elected position around 2000. A new chief is elected after every four years. The Akenfa community is known to have the largest youth population in the kingdom, and these youth are known to be the pillars of the community. The youth are led by a locally elected official known as the Youth-President. This Youth-President is formally responsible for the youth's welfare and he makes the decisions for the youth. Another role of the youth president is to represent the community in youth affairs, the currently elected youth president is Mr. Mandi. 
Another recognized leader of the community is the Community Development Committee chairman (CDC), which is also locally elected, the current CDC chairman is Mr. John O. Osomu. The major role of the CDC chairman is to be in charge of all developments coming to the community.
The Yenagoa community in the Epie-Atissa clan is the capital of Bayelsa State, and the chief of the Yenagoa community is known as HRH M.A Clarkson Kikile Oguo V, Ebeni-Eken of Yenagoa.
==Significant events==
* 23 July 2007: Two expatriates working for MTN Nigeria Limited in Akenfa-Epie, a village outside of Yenagoa, were abducted by gunmen. and a kid was found in the Epie creek 2 days after the gunmen killed the teacher, and some students.
* Early November 2013: the youths of Akenfa-Epie were attacked in the forest by the neighboring community; Agudama-Epie. One died many where injured and one went missing.

==References==The 'Kabo tribe' (Kabowei, Kabu-Owei) of the Ijaw people lives in the vicinity of Patani in Delta State, Nigeria. The tribe gets its name from its founder, Kabo, and from Kabobolou Creek. Two Kabo towns (Kolowari and Aven) are located along the creek. Other Kabo settlements include: Patani, Elemebiri (Ofonibeingha), Asamabiri, and Ekperiwari.
Because of their close contact with neighboring peoples, most Kabo are bilingual, speaking their own Ijaw dialect as well as the Urhobo or Isoko language. 
The Pere of Kabu-Owei is the paramount ruler of the Kabu-Owei Kingdom. The towns, which make up the Kabu-Owei Kingdom, are Koloware, Aven.

Altogether there are nineteen quarters (towns) in Kabu-Owei. Koloware is the eldest of the Kobuowei quarters. Patani, comprising eight quarters, is the headquarters of the clan and the seat of the paramount traditional ruler. The Pere of Kabu-Owei Kingdom Barr Shedrack  Erebulu 
The Aduwo II. He is a first class recognized and gazette traditional ruler and a member of the Delta State Council of Chiefs while the other side of the divide (Bayelsa State) has three third class recognized traditional rulers. The title of Opuodubowei of Kabu Owei Kingdom is the highest traditional title to be bestowed on any individual from the kingdom.
==History==
Centuries ago, Kabobolou Creek was the main channel of the Forcados River. According to local oral traditions, the Kabo tribe built a barrier on the river in order to prevent European ships using the river to conduct slave raids. The Kabo cooperated with the nearby Kumbo tribe to divert the Forcados onto its current course. As a result of this diversion, however, the Kabo lost their commercial preeminence to the Mein, who dominated the banks of the lower Forcados River. The Kabo remained confined to the banks of the small Kabobolou Creek. Over time, the clan sought to expand its influence beyond this backwater. The result of this expansion effort was the establishment of the town of Patani. The name "Patani" is derived from the Kabo rallying cry during slave raids: 'paa tein' ('Let us push adrift').

==References=='Viswanatha Nayak' was the Vijayanagara viceroy to Madurai in south India during the 16th century. He later became the ruler of Madurai after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire. He is the founder of the Nayak dynasty of Madurai.
He was supported by his general Ariyanatha Mudaliar who led  Viswantha Nayak's army became second in command and took power along with the latter in Tirunelveli in southern India. Viswantha Nayak was then succeeded by his son Krishnappa Nayak who along with his father's able minister Ariyanatha expanded the Madurai Kingdom under the Nayaks and brought most of the ancient Pandyan territory under its rule.
==History==
Madurai Nayak Kingdom'
He was the son of Nagama Nayaka, the successful general of Krishnadevaraya in the Vijayanagara empire. In the early 16th century, the Chola ruler Veerasekara Chola invaded the Madurai country and deposed the Pandya king Chandrasekara Pandyan. 
The Pandya king was under the protection of the Vijayanagara empire and he appealed to the court of Vijayanagara, and an expedition under Kotikam Nagama Nayaka was sent to his aid. Nagama suppressed the Chola ruler and took Madurai, but then suddenly he threw off his allegiance and declining to help the Pandya king, usurped the throne. The Vijayanagara emperor demanded that someone cure the defection: Nagama’s own son, Viswanatha, volunteered, and the king sent him with a large force against the rebel. He overthrew his father and handed him over to the emperor and as a reward for his loyalty the king appointed Viswanatha Nayaka as the governor of Madurai  and other provinces in the Tamil country thus leading to formation of the Nayak Kingdom of Madurai in 1529.
The Nayaks protected the southern districts from invasion of Mysore and Deccan sultans

Second, this guy is memorialized in a few books (and Reyk, your second reference is really wild; besides, notability for his 'ridiculous impostures' could conceivably be established), and that's enough for me.

She served as a member of the National Assembly of France for several terms between 1991 and 2017, and held various roles in the Government of France from 1995; she was Minister of the Sea in 2002 and Minister of Gender Equality from 2002 to 2005. She has been a member of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women since 2008 and was the committee's chairperson from 2013.
She represented the department of Calvados as a member of The Republicans.
== Biography ==
Titled a Doctor of law, specialising in the environment, she entered the office of the Minister for the Environment, Michel d'Ornano.  A powerful man from Calvados, he convinced her to invest in her native department.  After administrative posts at Honfleur then on the Conseil Général du Calvados, she entered politics  as deputy to Michel d'Ornano on the National Assembly of France in 1988, and took over from him on his death in 1991.
In 1993, with Yves Boisseau as deputy, she was elected with a large majority in the second round on the UDF ticket.  She was opposed by a National Front candidate, and on the left by Corinne Lepage, who failed to qualify for the second round.
In May 1995 with the victory of Jacques Chirac, she left her post in order to enter the Government of Alain Juppé.  The same year, she headed the Hornfleur Majorité Présidentielle list for the municipality, but lost by 37 votes to an independent ecologist.  She left the government in November with the other "Juppettes" and she easily regained her seat in December.
Re-elected following the dissolution of 1997, she was the only member on the Calvados right. The following year, she joined the Regional Council of Lower Normandy, as Vice President, deputy to René Garrec, president of the region since 1986.
 
Re-elected as a member in 2002 under the banner of the 'Union pour la majorité présidentielle', newly created from the UMP, she was a minister in the Raffarin government, responsible for the Sea for one month, then had full responsibility for Parity and Professional Equality, up until Jean-Pierre Raffarin's resignation on 31 May 2005.

The '4th Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery Regiment' was a unit that served in the Union Army during the latter part of the American Civil War. It was formed from former Unattached Companies of Heavy Artillery raised by Massachusetts to serve the state and for the defenses of Washington, D.C..
==History==
In the late summer of 1864, fourteen companies of heavy artillery were raised throughout Massachusetts for the purpose of coastal defense of the state. They were to be "unattached", thus not part of a regiment, and sent to various military locations for a one-year term. They were numbered 17 through 30, and were the Unattached Companies of Heavy Artillery. They encamped on Gallops Island in Boston Harbor, where they organized and were mustered in during latter part of August and into the first days of September 1864. In September, they were ordered to Washington, DC for garrison duty in the forts surrounding the capital. The last companies to leave, the 29th and 30th, left on 26 Sept and 29 Oct, respectively.
On 12 Nov 1864, a War Department order consolidated 12 of the companies, numbered 17 through 28, into one regiment, the 4th Regiment Massachusetts Heavy Artillery. Col William Sterling King, formerly of the 35th Massachusetts Infantry, was put in command. They remained in Washington for the remainder of the war, until their mustering out on 17 June 1865.
===29th and 30th Unattached Companies===
While the 17th through 28th Unattached Companies were combined into a single regiment, the 29th and 30th remained single units. They also served in garrisoning the forts around the capital until their time of mustering out on 16 June 1865. The 29th, with 157 officers and enlisted men, lost 2 to disease, while the 30th lost none of their 150 volunteers.
==Complement==
The regiment consisted of 72 officers and 1757 enlisted men, 21 of them dying by disease or accident.

Having begun his professional acting career at age ten, Vogel is widely known for his role as the red-headed orphan, Jamie Hunter-Cartwright on the NBC western series 'Bonanza', as well as for his feature film roles: as Tommy North in 'Yours, Mine and Ours' and as Lucius McCaslin in  'The Reivers'.
Clockwise from top left: Christopher George, Ross Martin, and Mitch Vogel on TV's 'The Immortal'
==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born in Alhambra, California, Vogel began his acting career at the age of ten, appearing in stage productions of 'Tom Sawyer', 'Heidi', 'Peter Pan' and 'The Wizard of Oz'.  As his acting career progressed, he attended Heinz Kaiser Junior High School in Costa Mesa, California, from 1969 to 1970 and later attended Jordan Jr. High school in Burbank, California.
===Acting career===
Vogel made his feature film debut at the age of 12, appearing in the 1968 comedy 'Yours, Mine and Ours', as one of Lucille Ball's and Henry Fonda's brood. He rose to prominence the following year as Lucius McCaslin in the feature film 'The Reivers', which earned him a Golden Globe nomination as the Best Supporting Actor of 1969.
Having established himself in feature films, Vogel briefly appeared on an episode of 'Bonanza' broadcast on October 6, 1968, entitled "The Real People of Muddy Creek". Two years later he joined the 'Bonanza' cast, co-starring as Jamie Hunter, an adolescent orphan taken in and eventually adopted by the Cartwrights during the last three seasons of the series.
In addition to his role on 'Bonanza', Vogel also guest-starred on several other western television series of the time, including 'The Virginian', 'Here Come the Brides', 'Gunsmoke', and 'Dundee and the Culhane', as well as appearing in a recurring role as "Johnny Johnson" on the western frontier series 'Little House on the Prairie' from 1974 to 1975, after which he had a starring role in the 10th episode of the Saturday morning live-action show, The Secrets of Isis.
In addition to his guest-starring roles on episodic television series, Vogel also appeared in lead roles in the 'Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color' films, 'Menace on the Mountain' in 1970 and 'The Boy from Dead Man's Bayou' in 1971, as well as co-starring in the made-for-television films 'Born Innocent' in 1974 and 'State Fair' in 1976.
===After acting===
In 1978, Vogel left show business and began a life away from the limelight. He formed a rock band and moved to Pittsburgh PA. He was married in 1985 and the couple have two daughters.  Vogel lives in the Southern California area and has spent time directing and appearing in church plays, as well as singing in a band.
In 2002, Vogel returned to 'Bonanza's locations for the Travel Channel's 'TV Road Trip', in which he narrated an account of his visit to the Ponderosa Ranch in Incline Village near Lake Tahoe, Nevada. In 2004 he was featured in an interview in 'Bonanza Gold' magazine. He participated in both the 2005 Bonanza Convention and the 2010 Bonanza Weekend in Liverpool, England.
Vogel was featured in an interview published online on 19 January 2017, in which he described how he had been cast for his part on Bonanza.

He was a member of the National Assembly from 2007 to 2017
==Career==
Dussopt was a member of the Socialist Party from 2000 to 2017. From 2007 until 2017, he was a member of the National Assembly. In parliament, he served on the Committee on Economic Affairs (2007-2009) and the Committee on Legal Affairs (2009-2017). 
In addition to his parliamentary activities, Dussopt worked on Manuel Valls’ campaign team in the Socialist Party's primaries for the 2017 presidential election. Following the 2017 French legislative election, he was among a minority that voted against the Philippe government's proposal for the 2018 national budget.
On 27 November 2017, Dussopt was appointed by President Macron to the position of Secretary of State to the Ministry of Public Action and Accounts, under the leadership of minister Gérald Darmanin. Soon after that, he was expelled from the Socialist Party. On 24 December 2017 he resigned from the National Assembly.
==Controversy==
On 20 May 2020, French online investigative and opinion newspaper 'Mediapart' revealed that the French utility company Saur gave him a present of lithographs by Gérard Garouste for a value of 2,000 euros in January 2017, just a few days before he announced a contract for a hydroelectric turbine with the same company in his town of Annonay.  
After the revelations, he initially answered that it was "A gift from a friend", but later  he recognized that it was a gift from the company, and he promised to give back the lithographs. Additionally, the Saur employee who gave him the gift declared that he was not a friend of Dussopt, but that Dussopt was just a client.

}In computer science, the 'worst-case complexity' (usually denoted in asymptotic notation) measures the resources (e.g. running time, memory) that an algorithm requires given an input of arbitrary size (commonly denoted as 'n' or 'N'). It gives an upper bound on the resources required by the algorithm.
In the case of running time, the worst-case time-complexity indicates the longest running time performed by an algorithm given 'any' input of size 'n', and thus guarantees that the algorithm will finish in the indicated period of time. The order of growth (e.g. linear, logarithmic) of the worst-case complexity is commonly used to compare the efficiency of two algorithms.
The worst-case complexity of an algorithm should be contrasted with its average-case complexity, which is an average measure of the amount of resources the algorithm uses on a random input.
== Definition ==
Given a model of computation and an algorithm 'A' that halts on each input 'x', the mapping 't'A:{0, 1}*→'N' is called the 'time complexity' of 'A' if, for every 'x', 'A' halts after exactly 't'A('x') steps.
Since we usually are interested in the dependence of the 'time complexity' on different input length, abusing terminology, the time complexity is sometimes referred to the mapping TA:'N'→'N', defined by TA('n'):= max'x'∈{0, 1}'n'{tA('x')}.
Similar definitions can be given for space complexity, randomness complexity, etc.
== Examples ==
Consider performing insertion sort on 'n' numbers on a random access machine. The best-case for the algorithm is when the numbers are already sorted, which takes O('n') steps to perform the task. However, the input in the worst-case for the algorithm is when the numbers are reverse sorted and it takes O('n2') steps to sort them; therefore the worst-case time-complexity of insertion sort is of O('n2').

Its director is Nick Davis, a former British Army pilot. The company's goal is to provide for the safety and security of merchant ships as they make passage through the Maritime Security Patrol Area (MSPA) in the Gulf of Aden. The security team commonly includes a Team Leader and two other guards.  The team members have prior experience in a variety of organisations, including Royal Navy, British Army and British police.  The company's interim deck watch team provides non-lethal ship security through known high risk piracy areas, using necessary equipment, including long range acoustic device (LRAD). APMSS provides early warning of a potential pirate attack.
As of November 2008, APMSS has ten teams aboard ships in the MSPA region.  Teams cost £14,000 for three days.
==Notable incidents==
On 14 November 2008, an APMSS team on an unidentified chemical tanker dealt with its first attack. The pirates were successfully deterred from boarding the ship.
Two weeks later, on 28 November 2008, the chemical tanker  was attacked by Somali pirates.  According to APMSS, the security team fired water cannon at the pirates, zigzagged the vessel and used the LRAD, long enough for a distress signal to be made by the Biscaglia's captain; however, after fending off three or four attacks, the pirates overcame the measures, boarded the ship and continued to shoot at the security guards, leaving the security team no choice but to abandon the vessel.  The team hid on the roof until a rescue helicopter came near, then jumped into the water for rescue by coalition forces.  While in the water the pirates fired on the security force and tried to run them over with the ship.  APMSS was criticized for leaving the 27 person crew on the boat they were protecting, but the company defending their actions as necessary given the circumstances.  The incident caused the usefulness of LRADs to be called into question by Lloyd's List.

}'St. Paul's Church' is a historic Episcopal church in Lynchburg, Virginia, United States.  
==History==
Lynchburg's oldest Episcopal parish was established in 1822. A replacement building was constructed in 1852, which Vermont schoolteacher turned local businessman and vestryman Elijah Fletcher helped fund. By then, Fletcher had moved his principal residence back to Amherst, Virginia, and helped found Ascension Episcopal Church there, although he conducted business and owned property in both the village and city. After his death and the American Civil War, one of his daughters, Indiana Fletcher Williams, would marry Episcopal priest J. Henry Williams of New York, and after the death of their only child, Daisy, and (though her last will and testament) found Sweet Briar College (incorporated in 1901 and on whose board successive rectors of this parish sat).
The current building was planned in 1888, cornerstone laid on May 26, 1891, first service held in the still-unfinished building the week before Christmas 1895. It is on a different lot from the 1852 building, which by then was considered too small. The architect, Day of Philadelphia, would later become known for his collegiate Gothic designs on the campuses of Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University and Wellesley College. The belfry was added in 1912, pursuant to plans submitted by a local architectural firm, Lewis & Burnham, although not in the original Day plans. The same firm built a parish house at the same time. Although local tradition attributes the stained glass windows to Louis Tiffany, and they are of that school, no documentation supporting that attribution has yet been found.
In the 1960s, the parish bought the adjacent Carter Glass house for use as a parish house, the previous parish house being too small.
During remodeling in 1970s, the organ and choir were moved to the rear balcony and most chancel furniture removed.
==Architecture==
The building is of Richardsonian Romanesque design and constructed of gray granite (quarried in southwest Virginia), and trimmed with brownstone. A belfry was added in . Connected to the main sanctuary is the parish house, built in 1912.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  It is located in the Court House Hill-Downtown Historic District.

}'Ricardo ("Ricky") McDonald Ellcock' (born 17 June 1965) is a Barbados-born former English cricketer who played first-class and List A cricket between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. His career was seriously hampered by injury,
and despite being picked to tour with England in 1989–90 he was forced into retirement shortly afterward.
He was educated at Combermere School Barbados, Malvern College England, British Aerospace Flying College Scotland and The University of Westminster London.MSc Air Transport Planning and Management  After a couple of seasons of Second XI cricket, and immediately after taking 11 wickets in one such game against Warwickshire II, Ellcock made his full Worcestershire debut in a County Championship match against future employers Middlesex at Worcester at the end of 1982, still only 17 years old. He took three lower-order wickets and scored 0 in his only innings. His next match was against Scotland in the Benson & Hedges Cup at Mannofield Park, the first List A game to be played at the Aberdeen venue. Ellcock took one wicket and did not bat.
He played quite often in 1983, and ended the season with 25 first-class wickets at 37.24 and nine List A wickets at 17.88; the latter figure included 4/43 in a John Player Special League fixture against Kent,
a career best that he would equal six years later for Middlesex. In the English winter of 1983–84 he played for his native Barbados, as he would do again (albeit very briefly) in 1984–85.
In 1984 Ellcock picked up 29 first-class wickets, his highest in any one season, but his struggles with fitness meant that he would never again approach that figure for Worcestershire, and after three more seasons of little success he moved to Middlesex for the 1989 season. Although he did not play until June, he managed his most productive summer: 32 first-class wickets at under 20 runs apiece, and 16 wickets at 23 in the one-day game. He matched his List A best with 4/43 versus Nottinghamshire in July,
and a week later recorded his only five-wicket haul when he claimed 5/35 against Yorkshire in the Championship.
The England selectors were sufficiently impressed by Ellcock's form to call him up for the winter tour against West Indies. However, his tour had barely begun before it was over: he pulled up after just a few balls in the nets,
and when he was diagnosed with a stress fracture of his back he was forced to go home without having played a single match on tour.
Ellcock missed the entire 1990 season, but returned to play a few matches for Middlesex in 1991. Despite evidence of a possibility of improving, such as the six wickets he took against Somerset,
he was unable to make a success of his comeback and retired in mid-season. He became a pilot and was the first black captain with Virgin Atlantic.
His brother Dale Ellcock had a short career with Barbados.

:'Peer review' (this checklist is based off of the  example and incorporates some of the Featured article criteria as well)
Lots of work to do here.
#'Prose'
#:a. 'well written':  b. 'comprehensive':  c. 'factually accurate':  d. 'summary style': 
#:: At times, the article seems to be vouching for the airline. Not sure how marketing fits in to the 'History' section.
#'References'
#:a. 'use of inline citations':  b. 'reliable sources':  c. 'No original research': 
#:: WP:CIRCULAR on the second reference. Extensive use of airline company press releases, as well as aviation news media that rely on company press releases for information. This should be reexamined to determine if it contributes to POV in the article.
#'Style'
#:a. 'lead section':  b. 'appropriate structure':  c. 'conforms to WP:MOS':  
#:: The article has a lead section, but it is very spotty and disjointed in organization. Much of the other sections appear this way as well. 'History' barely gets underway before a subsection drags the article in a whole different direction from discussing the apparently short history of the airline.
#'Controversy'
#:a. 'neutral point of view':  b. 'stable, with no edit wars': 
#:: As I said before, the article seems a bit 'fanboyish' in its voice. The article has been steadily edited since the request for review with updates to fleet size, and other information, seemingly as the reports come in.
#'Graphics'
#:a. 'quality':  b. 'image licenses': 
#:: Winglet "logo" image is unnecessary and very low quality. It is placed into the 'Environment' section, but has nothing to do with EcoJet. It's license says that it is a non-free use of a company logo, but the infobox already has the logo displayed. However, the infobox logo lacks a non-free use justification on the image page.
#'Quality': 
#:'Article classification': 
#:: I would assess this as a Start-class, however the B-class checklist is much more forgiving and rates it as C-class. The article needs better organization, in writing as well as structure. It certainly seems to be tinted on the side of the company, rather than WP:NPOV. Perhaps this is through the extensive use of the airline's press releases as sources. --Born2flie (talk) 02:49, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

The park elevation is between  above sea level. The original portion of the park was deeded to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department by a local family. 
Original improvements were accomplished by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933, during the Great Depression. After this federal investment, the park was opened to the public around 1938. Indian Lodge was expanded and campground facilities were added by the state in 1967.
== History ==
Interest in developing a state park in the Davis Mountains began in earnest in 1923 when the Texas Legislature directed the newly created State Parks Board to investigate the area. However, the Parks Board failed to secure any land donations and had no appropriations to buy the land. 
By 1933, the Great Depression had so devastated the local economy that landowners agreed to donate 560 acres for the park. CCC Companies 879 and 881 arrived in June 1933 and began organizing their encampment, which they named Camp Washington Seawell, after the first commander of nearby Fort Davis. Their developments in the park included roads, an overlook shelter, two mess halls, stone picnic tables, fireplaces and steps, a latrine and "Indian Lodge," a motel and visitor facility.
== Features ==
The Civilian Conservation Corps built "Indian Lodge" in the 1930s.
The park is next to the Fort Davis National Historic Site and the two are connected by four miles of hiking trails. Within the park is the "Indian Lodge", an adobe motel with thirty-nine rooms. Sixteen were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s (completed in 1939) and twenty-four were added in a 1967 expansion by Texas Parks and Wildlife. A large bird blind next to the main road offers enclosed and open viewing areas for the many species of birds that are attracted to the feeders near the blind.
The park has seven miles of equestrian trails in the special use Limpia Canyon Primitive Area, the section of the park north of Texas State Highway 118.
=== Flora ===
Davis Mountains State Park receives more rain than the surrounding desert. A variety of trees are found here, such as Mexican pinyon ('Pinus cembroides'), Emory oak ('Quercus emoryi'), gray oak ('Quercus grisea') and one-seed juniper ('Juniperus monosperma'). Shrubs such as scarlet bouvardia ('Bouvardia ternifolia'), little-leaf leadtree ('Leucaena retusa'), trompillo ('Ipomoea hederifolia'), evergreen sumac ('Rhus virens'), fragrant sumac ('Rhus aromatica'), Apache plume ('Fallugia paradoxa'), little walnut ('Juglans microcarpa'), tree cholla ('Cylindropuntia imbricata'), Torrey yucca ('Yucca torreyi'), catclaw acacia ('Acacia greggii'), and agarita ('Mahonia trifoliolata') abound. The high elevations  above sea level, not in the park, boast ponderosa pine ('Pinus ponderosa') and quaking aspen ('Populus tremuloides').
== Fauna ==
Montezuma quail are regularly observed in the park. Woodhouse's scrub jays, white-winged doves, curve-billed thrashers, white-tailed deer and rock squirrels are among the most common wildlife seen. Collared peccary, cougars, and American black bears have also been recorded in the park.

Johar obtained at PhD in political science from Florida State University and worked as a professor at Kuwait University before being elected to the National Assembly in 1996.  While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Johar affiliates with the Shia deputies.
==Supports Citizenship for Bidun==
On December 4, 2008, Johar, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq AlـHubaini, Ali AlـDeqbasi, and Abdullah AlـBarghash submitted a draft law calling for the granting of Kuwaiti citizenship to all bidun (stateless) residents in the country. The bill proposes that citizenship be granted to all bidun who were included in the 1965 census and who have no criminal record. The new draft law differs from previous bills as it does not impose any restrictions on the naturalization of bidun and does not set a ceiling for the number of bidun that can be granted citizenship. They also suggested that the families of individuals who have died in service to the country be naturalized.
In addition, the lawmakers affirmed their belief that the families of POWs and the children of those who were martyred during the invasion be granted citizenship. The latest statistics reveal that more than 80,000 bidun currently reside in Kuwait.
==Opposes Changes to Textbooks==
Amid rumors that the Kuwaiti government was going to change its textbooks to remove possible references to religion and extremism, Johar said, “I hope the government will not bow to external blackmail and threats... and be forced to delete important sections of Islamic education."  According to Jawhar, the decision to rewrite textbooks came despite findings by specialist committees that current editions contain no references calling for violence and fanaticism or encouraging struggle against other religions. The committees found that those books contained sizable portions focusing on tolerance, brotherhood, equality, passion, cooperation and respect for the rights of non-Muslims.
==Support for Women's Suffrage==
Johar supported Kuwaiti women's right to vote, saying "By relating to Islam I can see -- and I also consulted a lot of experts in this regard -- that there is no contradiction between the women's vote and our Islamic values."
==Grilling of Education Minister Nouriya Al-Sabeeh==
Johar has an ongoing feud with Education Minister Nouriya Al-Sabeeh.  In May 2008, Johar joined with  Hussein Quwaian Al-Mutairi to accuse Al-Sabeeh of not cooperating with the Kuwaiti University teachers' union and to urge Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah not to retain her in the upcoming cabinet formation. In October 2008, Johar submitted a parliamentary request to publicly question Al-Sabeeh about her plans to introduce electronic learning into the school curriculums.
==Mandatory Retirement Age for Teachers==
On November 28, 2008, Johar joined MPs Abdullah Al-Roumi, Khaled AlـSultan Bin Essa, Musallam Al-Barrak, and Marzouq AlـHubaini Al-Azmi in formulating a bill to extend the mandatory retirement age for Kuwaiti teaching staff at Kuwait University from 65 to 70 years.  They argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent academicians by restricting retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. They recommended that a clause be added to the law such that the retirement age can become 70 years and can further be extended to 75 years.

*  Official website'Marshfield Dreams: When I Was a Kid' is a memoir written by the American writer, poet and educational consultant Ralph Fletcher, it covers his life from birth to age thirteen when his family moved from Marshfield, Massachusetts to Chicago.
==Summary==
Each short chapter tells of an incident growing up in a large family on Acorn Street in Marshfield, Massachusetts.  Ralph was the oldest of nine children.  Some of the stories told were Ralph being informed of his mother's pregnancy by a nosy classmate, his mother's game called "snuck up the rug" where the whole family got down and pulled dirt from the carpets.  Other stories include his father bringing home a pet chicken for each child and his great-grandmother who buried the kids' old teeth in the garden.
==Reception==
Anne O'Malley reviewing the book for Booklist said that "many of the vignettes have a choppy style and a heavy nostalgic tone, but for readers who enjoy imagining what it was like to be a kid in the days of yore, this has a certain charm."  Kirkus Reviews said that "this scrapbook of family moments is an amusing, charming and heartwarming memoir about a close family--close in terms of both small house space and their feelings for each other. A snapshot of small-world life that will open readers' eyes to the bonds of a peerless time and simpler lifestyle."  Alison Follos was very positive in her review for School Library Journal saying "Fletcher's connection to nature and the environment infuse every aspect of his life. Written with sagacious eloquence and gentle humor, this work stands strong in the ranks of authors' memoirs and autobiographies."  Karen Coats reviewing for The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books said "the short, episodic chapters-really more a sequence of vignettes-don't ask for any significant overlays of emotion or interpretation, so reluctant readers may appreciate the well-told but unobtrusive presentations of ordinary events."
